0,"query : letter frequencies for text identification i am posting this inquiry for sergei atamas ( satamas @ umabnet . ab . umd . edu ) , a research associate at the university of maryland at baltimore . his field is molecular biology , and his work involves comparing dna strings using various algorithms . i do n't understand the details well enough to pass them along . at any rate , one such algorithm relies upon frequencies with which the letters g , a , t , and c occur in the dna strings . he would like to explore the analogous use of letter ( sound ) frequencies in natural language texts . hence this posting . specifically , sergei wonders if any linguist subscribers could help steer him to recent literature concerning text identification based on letter frequencies . any suggestions could be sent directly to him at the above address , or to me and i ' ll pass them along . he would also be interested in collaborative work if this research connects with the work of any linguists or text processing specialists . he observes that very often work in one field would actually help work in a far-removed field , if only people knew what was going on over there . george fowler george fowler gfowler @ indiana . edu [ email ] dept . of slavic languages * * 1-317 - 726-1482 [ home ] * * [ try here first ! ] ballantine 502 1-812 - 855-2624 / - 2608 / - 9906 [ dept . ] indiana university 1-812 - 855-2829 [ office ] bloomington , in 47405 usa 1-812 - 855-2107 [ dept . fax ]

0,"request book information earlier this morning i was on the phone with a friend of mine living in south america . as we were talking in spanish , he said : "" si voy a la liberi ' a , comprare ' el libro "" which can be rendered into english as "" if i go to the bookstore , i will purchase it "" . i found this expression a bit unusual so i asked him saying that he really meant to say "" si fuese a la libreri ' a , comprari ' a el libro "" or "" if i were to go to the bookstore , i would buy it "" to which he said to me , "" ah , the subjunctive is dead in spanish ! "" . weather this is a matter of subjunctive discussion or not , is something to be left for another time . nevertheless , he mentioned in the course of our conversation that there is a book ( a spanish translation of a french original ) titled something like "" la muerte del subjuntivo "" or "" the demise / death of the subjunctive "" . does any one know of this book ? or books which may deal with similar content ? any and all help will be appreciated . joseph m kozono < kozonoj @ gunet . georgetown . edu >

0,"simultaneous prepositions and postpositions in pashto i ' m looking for analyses of nominal constructions ( in any language ) in which the np has _ both _ a preposition and a postposition . for example , pashto has constructions like the following , from herbert penzl , _ a grammar of pashto _ ( washington , d . c . : american council of learned societies , 1955 ) , p . 41 : we sarri te to man to ' to the man ' the preposition is sometimes optional , though the postposition is obligatory . since pashto is head-final ( the unmarked word order is sov ) , it 's tempting to take the postposition at face-value . however , there are some binding facts that suggest that a phrase containing an np + postposition is referential , and so it might be possible to analyze the postposition as some kind of case marker . i understand that there may be such a distinction between homophonous case markers and postpositions in japanese , for example . i 'd be grateful if anyone could suggest any articles that deal with these constructions . and if there are other linguists who are studying pashto , i 'd like to hear from you . thanks for any help ! taylor roberts < troberts @ mit . edu >

0,"policies moderators ' message a very happy 1995 to all our subscribers ! as you can see , linguist is back on line - - on the 8th , not the 5th as we had hoped , but we are now up and running at our new address . remember : those of you who post to linguist @ tamvm1 . tamu . edu can continue to use that address . but those of you who used to post to linguist @ tamsun . tamu . edu must change either to the . . . tamvm1 address or to linguist @ tam2000 . tamu . edu the latter is our new editorial address . the . . . tamsun address is now worse than useless : the machine itself has been taken off line by texas a&m , so any messages sent there will simply disappear into an internet black hole . they will not be forwarded to us . the new year 's issues start with this issue : 6 . 1 . however , the listserv swallowed some of the issues we posted on dec . 20 and is just now sending them out . so you probably received some issues of volume 5 ( 1994 ) only today . this is not what we intended - - indeed , we worked hard to clear the mailer and post all the messages we had received before we shut down on dec 21 . we realize that some of them had deadlines . however , listserv malfunctions are simply not within our control . the texas a&m sysop took a long ( well-deserved ) ( and , we hope , energizing ) christmas vacation . and , until his return , the listserv would not free the issues we had posted . and that , by a lightening transition , brings us to a few remarks on maintaining free discussion on linguist . as linguist grows , it becomes potentially more powerful - - some might say "" threatening "" - - by virtue of its role as an information source . it 's natural that controversial policies and postings should generate concern ; and last year we received a number of complaints , protests , and editorial suggestions . we tried to respond to every message individually ; but we 'd also like to publicly explain our policies and our current thinking about some of the issues that arose . if any of you care to respond , we can continue this discusson on linguist . * we received several requests that we check the accuracy of controversial claims and allegations before we post them . however reasonable this sounds , unfortunately it simply is n't possible . linguist processes 50-70 messages a day ; last year we assembled and posted 1600 issues ( as those of you with overfull mailboxes know ! ) ; and we get over 1000 database requests a week , about 1 / 4 of which require some kind of administrative interchange . we ask our 3 student editors to check messages for civility ( more on this below ) ; but they do n't have time to check anything which is not immediately before them on the screen . so there is no way that we can strive for the standards of accuracy of paper journals . and , of course , we aren ' t a journal ; we ' re a discussion list . the only effective check on the accuracy of any posting is the discussion itself . so the moral is : - - read with a little scepticism - - and , if you see an inaccuracy , post a correction * the preceding applies , of course , to _ professional _ content in postings ; we can't be responsible for the accuracy of anyone 's claims about the number of words for "" snow . "" nor - - and this is the problematic area - - can we check claims about anyone 's or any institution 's decisions , opinions , or conduct . we will make every effort to ensure that any such posting has professional relevance , is temperate in phrasing , and ( if at all possible ) does not mention names . we also try not to publicize controversies having only personal relevance , since we do n't want linguist to become simply a forum for private grievances . but more than that we can't do . * about more widespread grievances : we have gotten many protests about cutting off discussions that criticize specific schools of linguistics . our problem with some of these has been that the criticisms were anecdotal , ( sometimes ) devoid of academic content , and sounded personally aggrieved ( see above ) . also , adherents of the schools under attack were telling us they no longer felt welcome on the list . so - - not wanting linguist to become a grievance forum or a cause of unnecessary divisiveness in the discipline - - we cut off the discussions . but we admit that there are good arguments on the side of free speech . so we have decided at least not to cut off discussions abruptly . instead , we will warn "" next - to-last posting on x "" before we send out a "" last posting "" message . and we will post any responses on x received in the interim . also , we 'd like to reiterate that any discussion that could compare schools or theories and stick to the academic issues would be very welcome . we are not committed to protecting any school from _ scholarly _ criticism ; and , in fact , we would tell any protestors that this is a discussion list , and if they feel attacked they must defend themselves through discussion . * about civility : we never intended to become a kind of electronic miss manners , and , frankly , it often feels like a very strange role for your uncouth moderators . however , we ' re committed to keeping postings civil in tone because ( 1 ) more than one academic list has ( literally ) gone down in flames - - i . e . , the list has disbanded because the discussions got too personal and heated ; and ( 2 ) , as much as possible , we 'd like everyone - - not just the brave or foolhardy - - to feel comfortable entering a linguist discussion . so we do occasionally return postings with a request that the writer revise toward a less-inflammatory tone . ( we realize , of course , that what is / is not inflammatory is a judgment call ; and our judgment may be wrong . ) however , we have returned very few postings ; and - - interestingly - - we have never received anything but cooperation from the writers . * * * * * * so - - as we ' ve said before - - we think linguist subscribers , all 5700 of you , are a remarkably reasonable , tolerant , and generous set of people . if you have comments or suggestions about the editorial policies we ' ve sketched out above , we would like to hear them . have a very happy new year ! - helen & anthony

0,"sexism and language re lydie e . meunier 's latest , i did not mean to say that i consider oppression of any kind to be of no importance , but merely that in studying linguistic usages it is of no importance ( or at least less importance , ok ? ) what the real situation re oppression and the like is than what people perceive it to be . if ( as some seem to believe ) there is no oppression of women by men , i meant to say , that would not be what we would want to know in order to explain sexist language , so long as people believe that men are better , stronger , or whatever , so long as people believe that men are and deserve to be dominant and / or more prominent in public life , etc . because even if these things were not true ( although i think by large they obviously are ) , so long as people believe they are ( and certainly all cultures i am familiar with do ) , then that would suffice to explain sexist language . in the same way , we as linguists need not discuss the existence of god in order to be able to say that certain linguistic usages seem to be derived from such a belief . so , yes , i do believe women have been and continue to be oppressed in various ways , i am astounded that there are people who would deny it , but i also would say that in order to explain sexist language , that is not what we need to discuss . alexis manaster ramer

0,"uniformitarianism in response to the request for info on this topic , uniformitarianism as i understand it is the doctrine , which appears to have originated in geology , that assumes that the same laws apply to various processes ( originally , geological , then biological , but also social and linguistic ) in all time periods , thus allowing in particular reconstruction of various aspects of prehistory . i first read of it in some the essays of stephen j . gould , for whom this is a favorite theme . a useful source esp . for us linguists is the collection of articles language and earth , ed . by bernd naumann et al . , 1992 , amsterdam / philadelphia : john benjamins , although many potential readers will be turned off bu the fact that several important contributions are in german , which all too few scholars read any more . the index to this work lists many many references to uniformitarianism in different chapters . although i have not read any , i would think there would be books on charles lyell , who is supposed to have fathered modern geology , which would deal with this topic at length . alexis manaster ramer

0,"re : 6 . 1094 , qs : phonemicity of writing this is stimulated by richard sproat 's query about "" phonemic "" orthog - raphy , but presents an opportunity for a bibliographical notice . to answer the question directly , the number of languages with a "" phonemic "" orthography approaches zero . once in a while a spelling reform is imposed ( e . g . in czech or dutch - - though since the dutch seem to keep doing it , they apparently do n't get it right ) , and for a generation or two , orthography might be as regular as the language planners intended . but language changes , spelling does n't , so orthography soon diverges from pronunciation . very troubling is the use of the term "" grapheme "" as if it had a meaning - whereas "" phoneme "" is apologized for ! please see my article in 18th lacus forum ( 1991 ) with subsequent deiscussion in 21st lacus forum ( 1994 ) . a survey along the lines of what r . sproat requests will be avbailable toward the end of the year , when the world 's writing systems , edited by me and william bright , will be published by osxford university press . the focus is on how the writing systems of the world encode the phonolo - gies of the major languages that use them . members of the lsa received a mailing about the book , which offered a prepublication discount price of $ 100 , available until 31 august . i urge you to take advantage of it ! i have known for about a week that the book has 894 pages plus front matter and index , so the price is pretty reason - able , as such thinkgs go .

0,"re : 6 . 1049 , sum : e - mail citation on occasion i have heard or read papers , usually on discourse , that use as data excerpts from the conversation or interview books by studs terkel ( such as _ working _ or _ the good war _ ) . as a resident of chicago , i have the opportunity to hear studs terkel 's daily radio program broadcast on wfmt . once in a while , i have happened to read a passage in one of the books within a few days of hearing the same interview in a broadcast , and i have noticed that the published version does not correspond exactly to what is on the tape . that is , studs terkel edits the material for style before it goes into print . i had the opportunity to confirm this in a brief conversation with studs terkel on saturday afternoon , 29 july 1995 . ( he 's a lot haler than any 85 - year-old could expect to be . ) first , when i told him his works were being used as data by linguists , he was immensely pleased , and he said , "" you ' ve made my day "" ; but he also confirmed that he edits the words of his subjects before he publishes them , and gave me his blessing to announce this to linguists who may be interested . the conversations in terkel 's books give every impression of being the genuine words of the people who speak them - - and they would certainly recognize themselves in the excerpts - - but studs terkel is a very accomplished literary artist , and does n't want his work to be acclaimed as the ipsissima verba of his workers , his soldiers , or any of his other subjects . i ' m sure he 'd like to receive copies of papers that cite his writings ; you could send them to him c / o wfmt , 303 e . wacker drive , chicago , il 60601 . - peter t . daniels , pdaniels @ press-gopher . uchicago . edu

"" my thirty years with the chimpanzees of gombe . "" ( p 118 ) one of the most important milestones in the life of a young male is when he begins to travel away from his mother with other members of the community . the severing of apron strings is far more necessary for a young male than a young female . she can learn most of what she needs to know for a successful adult life whilst remaining in her family setting . not only can she watch her mother and her mother 's friends caring for their infants , but she can actually handle them herself , gaining much of the experience which she will need later when she has a baby of her own . and she can learn , during her mother 's ` pink days ' , a good deal about sex and the demands that will subsequently be made of her in that sphere . the young male has different things to learn . there are some aspects of community life that are primarily , though not entirely , male responsibilities = adsuch as patrolling , repelling intruders , searching out distant food sources , and some kinds of hunting . he cannot gain adequate experience in such matters if he remains with his mother . he must leave her and spend time with the males . = = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d michael newman provides some welcome references in the literature that provide data more specific for what we all know generally , that some terms are semantically marked for gender - - marine , lumberjack , nurse . regarding "" he "" - - it has biases for masculine interpretation - - no doubt about that for the current state of the language . in centuries before modern english , and into the modern english era , "" he "" was also a feminine pronoun . michael newman is "" skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on ot her aspects of cognition "" , whereas lydie meunier says "" "" studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic-he retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural "" . newman goes on to express accord with moulton 's "" kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinated category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical "" . this sounds like individual-for - the-class synechdoche . i do not think that the "" prestigious subset "" sufficiently describes he / man phenomena , does not hit the mark head on , because it assumes man is to woman under "" man "" , as kleenex is to puffs under "" kleenex "" . i think my use of the term "" tautonym "" focuses a little sharper on the genus-species aspect . the difference between coke and pepsi is more like the difference between joe and john , and of a different order than that between boys and girls . i am suggesting another way to see the generic phenomenon - - in part supported by what i quoted in detail from jakobson a few posts back : a man is a living generic person , only made distinctive for sex in contrast / juxtapostion with woman . generic he / man in language describes generic he / man in-the - flesh - - as unmarked for sex . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - to lydie meunier : i am glad to know that someone on linguistic has expertise in sociolinguistic practices during biblical times . could you provide some chapters and verses about the more-or - less slavery of wives to their husbands ? it 's true there are all kinds of depravities in the bible , in f = act joshua was quite an ethnic cleanser himself . do you know if there is anything in the bible about how wives of slaves were treated , as they wou = ld be "" double-slaves "" ? finally , you use the word "" sexism "" , so popular in our = common cultural vocabulary , but , aside from it being a political slogan , = how could we most appropriately define it in its non-political slogan sense , = as you use it ? = jeff weber =

0,"re : 6 . 1078 , re : 1053 , english only ( bilingualism ) i am writing to ask alexis manaster ramer a simple question concerning the universality of certain phenomena : how come about a hundred languages are spoken in present-day russia despite the attempts to russify everyone ? this linguist seems to be very active , yet unfortunately he tends to generalize the information he is aware of , judging by his contribution to the discussion on he / she pronouns and his remarks concerning russian linguistic policies . i would like to tell him of a common example concerning various ethnicities in russia : in 1553 czar ivan the dreadful incorporated the mari , mordvin ( finnic ) , chuvash and tatars ( turkic ) nationalities into his state . nowadays these peoples live in the very heart of russia on the middle volga , and , apparently , enjoy their culture and languages . they have also contributed to the culture and language of the dominant nation . the infamous cossacks ( farmers living on the borders of the state and ready to resort to arms to protect them , a sort of michigan militia ) have preserved their language while acquiring a lot of culture from , say , mountaineers of the caucausus . yet they did not assimilate those peoples who still speak their languages . to draw parallels between nostratic universal processes and the language policies of russia might hardly be considered an appropriate example . it would rather be the opposite of the desired . valeri vassiliev st . john 's

0,"cfp : workshop on spoken language generation and multimodal information systems 2nd ` speak ! ' workshop : speech generation in multimodal information systems and practical applications 2nd - 3rd november 1995 gmd / ipsi , darmstadt , germany * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * call for contributions * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this workshop aims to bring together researchers , developers , and potential producers and marketers of multimodal information systems in order to consider the role of * spoken language synthesis * in such systems . not only do we need to be able to produce spoken language appropriately - - - including effective control of intonation - - - but also we need to know in which practical contexts spoken language is most beneficial . this requires a dialogue between those providing spoken natural language technology and those considering the practical use of multimodal information systems . the workshop will consist of paper presentations and practical demonstrations , as well as a roundtable discussion on the best strategies for pursuing the practical application of spoken language synthesis technology in information systems . suggested topic areas / themes include , but are not limited to : * functional control of intonation in synthesized speech * use of speech in intelligent interfaces for information systems * integration of speech into automatic query systems * cooperative integration of speech with text generation for information systems * evaluation strategies for information systems involving speech synthesis * applications for information systems with spoken language output capabilities * practical requirements for information systems with spoken language capabilities . potential participants are invited to submit short statements of interest indicating whether they would be interested in presenting a paper , offering a system demonstration , participating in the round table discussion , or simply attending . statements of interest and extended abstracts ( max . 7 pages ) should be sent by 1st . october by e-mail to : ` bateman @ gmd . de ' or by post to : john a . bateman , gmd / ipsi , dolivostr . 15 , d-64293 darmstadt , germany . extended abstracts will be made available at the workshop . during the workshop current results and demonstrations of the eu copernicus program project ` speak !

"" is a european union funded project ( copernicus ' 93 project no . 10393 ) whose aim is to embed spoken natural language synthesis technology with sophisticated user interfaces in order to improve access to information systems . multimedia technology and knowledge-based text processing enhance the development of new types of information systems which not only offer references or full-text documents to the user but also provide access to images , graphics , audio and video documents . this diversification of the in formation offered has to be supported by easy-to - use multimodal user interfaces , which are capable of presenting each type of information item in a way that it can be perceived and processed effectively by the user . users can easily process simultaneously the graphical medium of information presentation and the linguistic medium . the separation of mode is also quite appropriate for the different functionalities of the main graphical interaction and the supportive meta-dialogue carried out linguistically . we believe , therefore , that a substantial improvement in both functionality and user acceptance is to be achieved by the integration of spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech that sounds unnatural and that is hard to listen to . high quality synthesized speech that sounds acceptable to humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . the effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings , rather than word sequences , and requires understanding of the functions of intonation . in the domain of sophisticated human-machine interfaces , we can make use of the increasing tendency to design such interfaces as independent agents that themselves engage in an interactive dialogue ( both graphical and linguistic ) with their users . such agents need to maintain models of their discourses , their users , and their communicative goals . the speak ! project , which was launched recently as a cooperation between the speech research technology laboratory of the technical university of budapest and the technical university of darmstadt ( in cooperation with gmd-ipsi ) , aims at developing such an interface for a multimedia retrieval system . at ipsi , the departments komet ( natural language generation ) and mind ( information retrieval dialogues ) contribute to this project . the project is to construct a proof-of - concept prototype of a multimodal information system combining graphical and spoken language output in a variety of languages . the work involves four supporting goals : first , to advance the state of the art in the domains of speech synthesis , spoken text generation , and graphical interface design ; second , to provide enabling technology for higher functionality information systems that are more appropriate for general public use ; third , to significantly improve the public and industrial acceptance of speech synthesis in general and the hungarian text-to - speech technology elaborated within the project in particular ; and , fourth , to act as a focusing point for speech work in hungary . contact points : gmd / ipsi , darmstadt : john bateman e-mail : bateman @ gmd . de fax : + 49 / 6151-869 - 818 tel : + 49 / 6151-869 - 826 tu - budapest : g ' eza n ' emeth e-mail : nemeth @ ttt - 202 . ttt . bme . hu fax : + 36 / 1-463 - 3107 tel : + 36 / 1-463 2401

0,"query : latin and romance the following hypothetical question has arisen in connection with what is possibly a real case of the same sort , but in another domain . suppose that latin had only occasionally been written down , and suppose that all latin texts , and indeed all knowledge of latin , had been totally lost long ago , apart perhaps from the odd place name or personal name , now of unknown significance . suppose further that only a single romance language had survived down to the present day - - say , galician , or gascon , or sicilian - - and that this variety had been written down for no more than four centuries and had never acquired any learned words from latin . in fact , to be on the safe side , let 's assume that the entire indo - european family had died out apart from this one romance language . now , suppose that a few fairly substantial latin texts happened to be dug up somewhere , none of them longer than about fifty words , with word-boundaries not systematically marked and the subject matter unknown ; these might have been written down over several centuries , but in no case later than the first century bc . knowing the alphabet , we would be able to read them at the phonological level , at least roughly , but at first the language would be utterly mysterious . so here 's my question . would it be possible for specialists in that last surviving romance language to establish that the recovered texts in fact represented an archaic form of that language , and would they be able to use their knowledge to interpret ( at least in part ) the texts themselves ? if anything turns up , i ' ll summarize the responses and explain what the point of this admittedly curious inquiry is . i ' m sending this query to both the linguist list and the ie list ; my apologies to those who receive it twice . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

0,"words that are their own opposites ( part 2 ) in my last summary ( linguist 6 . 74 ) i listed a collection of what i call auto-antonyms - - words that have two opposite meanings . for example , to "" clip "" may mean to cut a little piece off , or to put a little piece on . to "" look over "" may mean careful scrutiny or that you missed an important detail . sometimes the antonymy may be historical : "" nice "" used to denote an unpleasant quality . in that summary , i promised a discussion of whether any generalities could be made about such pairs . are they regularly motivated , or always a coincidence ? i ' m still editing the responses to that question . meanwhile , here are more auto-antonyms that got left out of last post : one auto-antonym that i seem to have overlooked in preparing my post , although i remember looking it over many times before , is "" moot "" , which at once means "" suitable for debate "" and "" not worth discussing "" . impregnable : able to impregnated or inable to be pregnated , as joel hoffman points out . cope ( s ) mate : used to mean antagonist and now means partner or comerade , says ariadna solovyova , who got the word off of anu garg 's a . word . a . day mailing list . it turns out that they were having a week celebrating "" fence-setters "" , evidently another term for what i ' ve been calling auto-antonyms . bruce nevin reminds us of an intercontinental auto-antonym pair : "" public school "" in britain is "" private school "" in the usa and vice versa . infer : historically ( and now , informally ) this means "" imply "" as well . rent , lease : several pointed out to me that these means both lend and borrow . in addition , dan myers wrote to tell me that chinese operates similarly with respect to this pair , and wolfgang lipp notes a similar auto-antonymy to represent "" give "" and "" take "" in pronunciation ( shou4 ) but not in writing . learn / teach : in "" sub "" - standard english , these two meanings fuse into "" learn "" , as they do in standard russian "" uchit ' "" here are some of my personal favorites that i left out of the first summary : sensitive : this may describe either someone with profound understanding for the feelings of others , and tolerates differences of opinion ( thus "" sensitivity training "" for group leaders ) as well as a paranoid who does n't listen to what people are really saying , and decides to take everything as a personal insult . hole / whole : spelled the first way , an entire absence of matter ; the second , entire presence . this reminds me of "" pit "" which can be either a hollow or the stone of a fruit . which reminds me of "" seeded "" oranges ( insert your favorite fuit here ) - - oranges with seeds ( as opposed to navel oranges , which have no seeds ) , or oranges that have had their seeds removed . if you think you ' re beginning to see some patterns here , you ' re not alone ! as i said , i ' ve received a few theories on the ultimate essence of auto-antonymy , historical , psychological , and sociological approaches . these theories show that auto-antonymy comes about for a variety of reasons . in a short while , i ' m going to put up a summary of these theories . then , i ' ll briefly cover related linguistic phenomena , such as words with synonyms that look suspiciously like antonyms : flammable / inflammable , ravel / unravel . oh , and by the way , it turns out i was not the first to come up with the term "" auto-antonym .

0,"grammatical relations and derived notions about two months ago i posted a query which , somewhat abbreviated , ran as follows : "" for some time , i have been puzzled by a claim that i come across frequently in the formal grammatical literature , namely that since grammatical relations are derived , therefore they cannot be referred to by the grammar . more specifically , my puzzlement is not concerned with why some people believe both that grammatical relations are derived and that grammatical relations cannot be referred to by the grammar , but rather with why they think the second belief follows necessarily from the first . i would be grateful for any enlightenment on this issue . "" my query did n't elicit a vast number of responses , so maybe i should conclude that people are n't really interested in this issue , but for those who might be interested i will summarize the responses . first , no one defended the position that i criticized . indeed , the general tenor , explicit or implicit , of the responses is that the position is erroneous . i am thus inclined to continue believing that it is an error that has unfortunately crept into the literature , one which i hope will disappear . some people pointed to other specific examples in linguistics and other sciences where derived notions play a crucial role , making it meaningful to argue about what are the correct derived notions . second , some people suggested that those who appear to make the claim in question might really be trying to say something different ( e . g . simply that the grammar should not refer directly to grammatical relations ) . but examination of the two most recent instances that i encountered , and which prompted me to post the query , shows that they only make sense if the claim is interpreted literally as i suggested . third , some people asked me to cite references to where the claim is made . i prefer not to do so . ( 1 ) it is n't my aim to embarrass anyone in front of the whole list ; there are others who are much better at that than i am . ( 2 ) it would be unfair to the authors of the two instances that i encountered most recently and which i remember - - i do n't see why i should cite them , especially as they are linguists whose work i respect - - while those i happen not to remember go uncited . i will be happy if the erroneous claim does n't appear in future . i am grateful to the following for their responses : dan finer , f . lehman , adam meyers , fritz newmeyer , sebastian shaumyan , jean - roger vergnaud . bernard comrie ( comrie @ bcf . usc . edu ) bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu

0,"sum : v - initial languages several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / > / f / > / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / > / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n't know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the "" fossilized noun-class prefix "" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

0,"summary : borrowings or replacements of ' ear ' some time i posted a query as to whether the term for ' ear ' is ever borrowed , or at least replaced by a neologism : here is a summary of the responses , for all of which i am very grateful and which i will again acknowledge in print , as the occasion presents ( an earlier summary contained other relevant discussion of the same topic ) : benji wald ( ibenawj @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) reports that in bantu the near-universal word for "" ear "" has the root * to . however , in sabaki ( kenyan coastal bantu , e . g . , swahili , pokomo , miji kenda ) the word is * sikilo ( e . g . , swahil sikio ) . this is based on the root * sikil "" hear "" ( e . g . swahili sikia ' hear ' ) ; the final - o is a bantu nominaliser . the most widespread bantu word for "" hear "" is not related to * sikil but has the morpheme * gu . thus in most of bantu the roots for "" ear "" and "" hear "" are not related . he also notes that some cushitic languages also derive ' ear ' from ' hear ' , somali deg "" ear "" deg-eyso "" hear "" , and suspects that the sabaki bantu construction for "" ear "" came about through contact , probably from cushitic . * * to this i would add that this also gives an example of replacement within afro - asiatic , of which cushitic is a part , since clearly this word is not related to , for example , the semitic word ( hebrew ozen , etc . ) - - amr * * bruce connell ( connellb @ vax . ox . ac . uk ) reports that , according to wilkins , david ( 1993 ) from part to person : natural tendencies of semantic change and the search for cognates . cognitive anthropology research group , max planck institute for psycholinguistics , working paper no . 23 : a ) semantic shift of ' ear ' to ' head ' is attested in bantu ; languages unspecified , but guthrie ( 1967-71 ) is ultimate source . b ) in dravidian , ' earring ' shifts to ' ear ' ; again languages unspecified , burrow and emaneau ( 1961 ) is ultimate source . i have also independently , i . e . , extra - linguist - ically , found out that laurent sagart argues that bai ( a minority language of china , i believe , whose genetic affiliations are controversial ) borrowed its word for ' ear ' from chinese , but that is not universally accepted . likewise , i have found an article by gregersen which assumes without detailed discussion that the vietnamese word for ' ear ' is borrowed from austronesian ( while this does not appear to be generally accepted either , it presumably at least indicates that the word in question is not a reflex of the mon - khmer prototype , and hence would be a replacement , but i have not yet checked this out ) . finally , i realized what i had been forgetting all along , namely , that many ( or is it all ? ) indo - aryan languages ( from sanskrit on down ) have a word for ' ear ' which is clearly not the indo - european word for ' ear ' , and hence a particularly clear example of a replacement . i thus still do not have an example of ' ear ' being borrowed which could be considered to be established beyond reasonable doubt , and would appreciate any references to such . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = in addition , i omitted the following response from my earlier summary of responses to a more general query about the borrowing of body part terms : h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ( henk wolf ) : dutch _ neus _ ( nose ) in west frisian has become an alternative to the native _ noas _ ( see breuker , p . et al ( 1984 ) , foar de taalspegel ; koart oersjoch fan holl ^ anske ynsl ^ upsels yn it frysk , ljouwert : afuk ) .

0,"summary : german terms for sibilant , shibilant , etc . just the other day i asked if anybody knew the german terms for sibilant , shibilant , and the category of sound which russian , georgian , etc . linguists know as , in effect , 's ibilant-shibilant ' ( of which the polish s-acute , c-acute , and z-acute , orthographically speaking , are examples ) . peter daniels noted that older german works on semitology do not use any special terms . carsten breul reported sibilant and schibilant , and also , for the former , zischlaut ( one wishes it were * zisslaut , but languages are only human ! ) . a source off linguist tells me that a shibilant is also a rauschlaut , although carsten tells me this does not appear to be a widespread usage ( but thinks it sounds very suitable ) . so , zischlaut and rauschlaut it is . but i guess there is still the problem of the remaining category ( which has names in russian and georgian , but not to my knowledge in english , french , or german ) . maybe we should collectively try to come up with something for each of these languages ? alexis manaster ramer

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately

0,"summary of multimodal refs summary to my query of early january : ) dear linguists , ) ) does anyone know of work - - studies , analyses - - in multimodal reference : ) i . e . how words and picture interact and refer to each other in texts ? ) thanks to all who responsed , among them : susan meredith burt , robert dale , karen emmorey , sharon flank , lisa frumkes , sabine geldof , james a . mcgilvray , georgia green , marti hearst , richard hirsch , sally jacoby , pirjo karvonen , john lee , dick oehrle , toshio ohori , laurent romary , deborah d k ruuskanen , roberta trites , mats wiren . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the background to my query is that my group has worked for some time with multimodal input to computer systems , using combinations of text and direct manipulation : point and click gestures . just recently we extended our scope somewhat , and we have just completed a first running version of a speech interface to a 3 - d graphic virtual environment . i myself am looking at reference resolution in the interface . we are currently in the process of experimenting and fooling about with it . i was surprised myself at the strong effects of visual focus and interactivity on referent choice in situations which could be construed as ambiguous , and conversely , how in certain constructions , the textual effects completely override visual and gestural cues . just recently we completed the first stage of the project . i will be happy to mail anyone a copy of our first tentative report on how things turned out . this led me on to a side track : i am currently working on a statistical study of a tintin album ( l ' oreille cassee ) to see how the pictorial mode of the text affects the structure of referential expressions . jussi karlgren , ivan bretan , niklas frost , lars jonsson . 1995 . ` ` interaction models for speech interfaces to virtual environments ' ' , proceedings of second eurographics workshop on virtual environments - - realism and real time , monte carlo . darmstadt : fraunhofer igd . integrating speech and virtual reality technology is being done simultaneously by several research groups , and there are several publications from various sources in the works . naturally , multimodality in the human computer interface can be more than speech , vision , and gestures , and a fair amount of work has been put into investigating effects of adding text input or output to graphical displays or vice versa . there are several studies made on multimodal aspects of human-human discourse , both spoken and in text form , some with an eye on application on human-computer interaction , and some not . several responses encouraged me to look more at studies of children 's literature : the standard reference to that appears to be nodelman , in the following list . the following list only contains the complete references i have been sent so far . they keep arriving , so i may post a revised version if i receive enough more material . naturally , the field is diverse and large , and this list does in no way even approximate the breadth and depth of study in the area , but much of the work in it is new to me . i hope it is of some use !

0,"sum : progressive with future time reference content - length : 6465 some time ago i posted a query concerning the possible existence of languages in which the morpheme expressing the notion of "" progressive "" may be used with future time reference , as in english : - i am leaving tomorrow . the coexistence of progressive and a future time adverbial is the decisive factor . i started from a very scanty piece of knowledge : besides english , i only know of icelandic ( quoted in a paper by karen ebert , that will appear in a volume on tense and aspect ) , and possibly kinyarwanda ( but i need more data concerning this language ) . as i suspected , this feature seems to be very rare . i got only two answers . the first one is from john koontz ( koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ) . since it is not particularly long , i reproduce it entirely : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the dhegiha branch of mississippi valley siouan all form progressives by pairing the simple verb with a positional auxiliary , and omitting the plural / proximate marker that otherwise occurs in the plural forms and the third person singular proximate . dhatha = i he ate / eats dhatha = i they ate / eat dhathe he ( obv ) ate / eats dhathe = akha he is eating dhathe = ama they are eating the usual reading of the simple form is past / aorist . there are special auxiliary and / or enclitic constructions for habitual . the future is formed with the enclitic = tte , which requires the auxiliary following it . dhathe = tta = akha he will eat dhathe = tta = ama they will eat the future without the auxiliary expresses polite requests , and there is also a form = tta = i = the ( no auxiliary ; basically the evidential of the future ) that has the reading ` shall surely ' . dhathe = tta = i = the he / they shall surely eat note also : dhatha = bi = ama they say that he ate / eats ( not the same ama , i believe ) dhatha = i = the it seems that he ate / eats john koontz = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = answering a further request of clarification , koontz kindly added the following ( the letter b presumably stands for my syrname ) : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ) the dhegiha branch of mississippi valley siouan all form progressives by ) pairing the simple verb with a positional auxiliary , and omitting the ) plural / proximate marker that otherwise occurs in the plural forms and the ) third person singular proximate . ) ) dhatha = i he ate / eats dhatha = i they ate / eat ) dhathe he ( obv ) ate / eats ) ) dhathe = akha he is eating dhathe = ama they are eating b ) why are there two forms : akha and ama ? these auxiliaries are identical to the definite articles , and like them code the shape / posture / motion of the subject . historically there are derived from positional verbs and particles . = akha is the singular / motionless / proximate form = ama is the plural or singular / moving / proximate form other forms are used in the first and second persons , generally derived from the sitting article / auxiliary , e . g . , mi ~ khe ` i the sitting ' , ni ~ khe ` you the sitting ' . the stem is dhi ~ khe ` ( he ) the sitting ' . ) the usual reading of the simple form is past / aorist . there are special ) auxiliary and / or enclitic constructions for habitual . b ) your gloss indicates indicates present meaning , non only past / aorist b ) meaning . a present , non-progressive reading is possible in appropriate contexts . i believe such forms are essentially nomic . ) the future is formed with the enclitic = tte , which requires the auxiliary ) following it . ) ) dhathe = tta = akha he will eat dhathe = tta = ama they will eat b ) does it have progressive and future meaning , or only future ? no trace at all of progressive reading that i have detected . the forms without the auxiliary are limited to those mentioned , i . e . , the future of surity with = the appended , and the future of polite requests , used without further marking , in the second person . ) the future without the auxiliary expresses polite requests , and there is ) also a form = tta = i = the ( no auxiliary ; basically the evidential of the ) future ) that has the reading ` shall surely ' . ) ) dhathe = tta = i = the he / they shall surely eat ) ) note also : ) ) dhatha = bi = ama they say that he ate / eats ( not the same ama , i believe ) ) dhatha = i = the it seems that he ate / eats ) ) john koontz similar patterns occur in all of the dhegiha languages , i . e . , omaha - ponca , osage , kansa ( kaw ) , and quapaw . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the second answer is from lars anders kulbrandstad ( larsanders . kulbrandstad @ hamarlh . no ) . unfortunately , there are some misterious characters , but the content is sufficiently clear . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = there is no fullfledged progressive construction in norwegian , but we have something that still might be of interest to you . dialects in the south-eastern part of the country have a future construction consisting of the auxilliary "" bli "" ( literally = 3d "" get , become "" = ) in the present tense + present participle of the main verb . the sentence corresponding to "" i will be going to oslo tomorrow "" would be "" je blir draens ( = 3d "" i + get / become + going "" ) tel oslo i m = e5r = e5 !

0,"re : grammar / syntax courses at the college freshman / sophomore level i would like to hear from people who teach or know of grammar or syntax courses offered at the college freshman or sophomore level . we teach such a course at north seattle community college . it concentrates on syntax and teaches a formal , traditional approach to it . we even use reed - kellog diagrams rather than phrase structure trees . another piece of the course applies the syntax to the improvement of writing . in that part of the course we use sentence combining . the course was created here by my colleague , edith wollin , and i know that , in its present form , it is probably unique . it should be taught elsewhere , for it is very successful . students praise it and recommend it to other sdtudernts . they even say it makes them better readers ! we present the material at a level and pace that would make it too challenging for many developmental-level students . the course is certainly as rigorous as sany other 100 - level and 200 - level course in most colleges ; indeed , we think it rivals many higher-level courses in usefulness . but we are aware that it does not present the broad linguistics-based grammar covered in the typical 300 - level grammar course . one professor of such a course at the university of washington told me our course sounds like excellent preparation for his . he said he would love to get students who already know what a clause is . i would be grateful to hear from colleagues who know of any kind of grammmar or syntax course at the freshman or sophomore level . thanks . michael kischner north seattle community college seattle , wa 98103 ( 206 ) 528-4540

0,"re : 6 . 100 sum : ipa history & haceks , stemberger suggests that north american linguists who use haceks are following a tradition which is just as international as that of the international phonetic association , which he labels a western european organization . even a cursory glance at the ipa membership list would have shown him that the ipa is an international body , with many north american members . it is governed by an elected council , with over half the members coming from outside western europe , several of the council being from the united states , others from eastern europe ( poland and russia ) , and others from china , japan , australia , finland , south africa , and nigeria . it is the north american linguists who use diverse symbols who are not following truly international conventions . having said that , let me say that i happen to agree with him that it would be appropriate to use haceks for palato-alveolar sounds . the hacek would then be a diacritic marking a natural class of sounds . i proposed this at the 1989 kiel convention of the ipa , but i was voted down by my more conservative colleagues , who consider it important to keep the ipa as stable as possible . i see their point of view , but prefer mine . nevertheless there is no point in having democratically approved international standards unless one keeps to them , so i will reluctantly avoid haceks . peter ladefoged

0,"chechen who are the chechen ? johanna nichols university of california , berkeley author 's note : i have been doing linguistic field work on chechen and its close relative ingush for many years . though i am not an ethnographer or historian , i have tried to bring together here some general information about the chechen people and their language in order to increase public awareness of the people and their situation , and to put a human face on a people of great dignity , refinement , and courage who have paid heavily for their resistance to conquest and assimilation . this paper may be copied freely . if you disseminate it electronically or print it out yourself ( which you are welcome to do ) , reformatting ( font , spacing , etc . ) is ok but please do not edit it . johanna @ uclink . berkeley . edu fax : 510 642-6220 phone ( 510 ) 642-2979 introduction . the chechens and their western neighbors the ingush are distinct ethnic groups with distinct languages , but so closely related and so similar that it is convenient to describe them together . the term "" chechen "" is a russian ethnonym taken from the name of a lowlands chechen village ; "" chechnya "" is derived from that . ( both words are accented on the last syllable in russian . ) this term evidently entered russian from a turkic language , probably kumyk ( spoken in the northern and eastern caucasian plain ) . the chechens call themselves nokhchi ( singular nokhchuo ) . similarly , "" ingush "" is not the self-designation but a russian ethnonym based on a village name ; the ingush call themselves ghalghay . demography . 1989 census figures : 956 , 879 chechen ; 237 , 438 ingush . the chechens are the largest north caucasian group and the second largest caucasian group ( after the georgians ) . location , settlement . the chechen and ingush lands lie just to the east of the principal road crossing the central caucasus ( via the darial pass ) , extending from the foothills and plains into alpine highlands . the lowlands enjoy fertile soil , ample rainfall , a long growing season , and a small oilfield . neighbors to the east are the various peoples of daghestan ( many of them speaking languages related to chechen ) ; in the plains to the north , the turkic - speaking kumyk and ( as of the last three centuries ) russians ; to the west the ingush and to their west the ossetians , who speak a language of the iranian branch of indo - european ; to the south ( across the central caucasus range ) the southern ossetians and the georgians . there are two true cities in chechen and ingush territory : grozny ( pop . about 400 , 000 until 1995 ) , the modern chechen capital founded as a russian fort during the russian conquest of the caucasus ; and vladikavkaz ( pop . about 300 , 000 ; known as ordzhonikidze in soviet times ) in the ingush highlands at the ingush - ossetic territorial boundary , also originally a russian military fort and founded to control the darial pass . nazran in the ingush lowlands was traditionally and is now a large and important market town . the cities had substantial russian and other non - chechen - ingush population ; vladikavkaz was mixed ingush and ossetic with significant numbers of russians and georgians . ( groznyj has now been destroyed and mostly depopulated by russian bombing . vladikavkaz and the adjacent ingush lands were ethnically cleansed of ingush in late 1992 . ) all russian governments - - czars , soviets , post - soviet russia - - have used various means to remove chechen and ingush population from economically important areas and to encourage settlement there by russians and russian cossacks ; hence the mixed population of the cities and lowlands . language . the caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the sheer number and diversity of its languages and for the exotic grammatical structures of the language families indigenous there . this diversity testifies to millennia of generally peaceable relations among autonomous ethnic groups . chechen and ingush , together with batsbi or tsova - tush ( a moribund minority language of georgia ) make up the nakh branch of the nakh - daghestanian , or northeast caucasian , language family . there are over 30 languages in the northeast caucasian family , most of them spoken in daghestan just to the east of chechnya . the split of the nakh branch from the rest of the family took place about 5000-6000 years ago ( thus the nakh - daghestanian family is comparable in age to indo - european , the language family ancestral to english , french , russian , greek , hindi , etc . ) , though the split of chechen from ingush probably dates back only to the middle ages . the entire family is indigenous to the caucasus mountains and has no demonstrable relations to any language group either in or out of the caucasus . like most indigenous caucasian languages chechen has a wealth of consonants , including uvular and pharyngeal sounds like those of arabic and glottalized or ejective consonants like those of many native american languages ; and a large vowel system somewhat resembling that of swedish or german . like its sister languages chechen has extensive inflectional morphology including a dozen nominal cases and several gender classes , and forms long and complex sentences by chaining participial clauses together . the case system is ergative , i . e . the subject of a transitive verb appears in an oblique case and the direct object is in the nominative , as is the subject of an intransitive verb ( as in basque ) ; verbs take no person agreement , but some of them agree in gender with the direct object or intransitive subject . 97 % or more of the chechens claim chechen as their first language , though most also speak russian , generally quite fluently . chechen and ingush are so close to each other that with some practice a speaker of one has fair comprehension of the other , and where the two languages are in contact they are used together : a chechen addresses an ingush in chechen , the ingush replies in ingush , and communication proceeds more or less smoothly . chechen was not traditionally a written language . an orthography using the russian alphabet was created in the 1930 's and is used for various kinds of publication , although for most chechens the chief vehicle of literacy is russian . traditionally , as in most north caucasian societies , many individuals were bilingual or multilingual , using an important lowlands language ( e . g . kumyk , spoken in market towns and prestigious as its speakers were early converts to islam ) for inter-ethnic communication ; any literacy was in arabic . russian has now displaced both kumyk and arabic in these functions . particularly if the chechen and ingush economies continue to be destroyed and unemployment and mass homelessness continue to undermine the social structure , there is danger that chechen and ingush will be functionally reduced to household languages and will then yield completely to russian , with concomitant loss of much of the cultural heritage . history . the chechens have evidently been in or near their present territory for some 6000 years and perhaps much longer ; there is fairly seamless archeological continuity for the last 8000 years or more in central daghestan , suggesting that the nakh - daghestanian language family is long indigenous . the caucasian highlands were apparently relatively populous and prosperous in ancient times . from the late middle ages until the 19th century , a worldwide cooling phase known as the little ice age caused glacial advances and shortened growing seasons in the alpine highlands , weakening the highland economies and triggering migrations to the lowlands and abandonment of some alpine villages . this period of economic hardship coincided with the russian conquest of the caucasus which lasted from the late 1500 's to the mid - 1800 's . in all of recorded history and inferable prehistory the chechens ( and for that matter the ingush ) have never undertaken battle except in defense . the russian conquest of the caucasus was difficult and bloody , and the chechens and ingush with their extensive lowlands territory and access to the central pass were prime targets and were among the most tenacious defenders . russia destroyed lowlands villages and deported , exiled , or slaughtered civilian population , forcing capitulation of the highlands . numerous refugees migrated or were deported to various muslim countries of the middle east , and to this day there are chechen populations in jordan and turkey . since then there have been various chechen rebellions against russian and soviet power , as well as resistance to collectivization , anti-religious campaigns , and russification . in 1944 the chechens and ingush , together with the karachay - balkar , crimean tatars , and other nationalities were deported en masse to kazakhstan and siberia , losing at least one-quarter and perhaps half of their population in transit . though "" rehabilitated "" in 1956 and allowed to return in 1957 , they lost land , economic resources , and civil rights ; since then , under both soviet and post - soviet governments , they have been the objects of ( official and unofficial ) discrimination and discriminatory public discourse . in recent years , russian media have depicted the chechen nation and / or nationality as thugs and bandits responsible for organized crime and street violence in russia . in late 1992 russian tanks and troops , sent to the north caucasus ostensibly as peacekeepers in an ethnic dispute between ingush and ossetians over traditional ingush lands politically incorporated into north ossetia after the 1944 deportation , forcibly removed the ingush population from north ossetia and destroyed the ingush villages there ; there were many deaths and there are now said to be up to 60 , 000 refugees in ingushetia ( about one-quarter of the total ingush population ) . in developments reminiscent of today 's invasion of chechnya , in the weeks leading up to the action the ingush were depicted ( inaccurately ) in regional media as heavily armed and poised for a large-scale and organized attack on ossetians , and the russian military once deployed appears to have undertaken ethnic cleansing at least partly on its own initiative . ( my only sources of information for this paragraph are russian and western news reports . helsinki watch is preparing a report for publication in early 1995 . ) the invasion of chechnya presently underway has meant great human suffering for all residents of the chechen lowlands , including russians , but only the chechens are at risk of ethnic cleansing , wholesale economic ruin , and loss of linguistic and cultural heritage . religion . the chechens and ingush are sunni muslims of the hanafi school , having converted in the late 17th to early 19th centuries . islam is now , as it has been since the conversion , moderate but strongly held and a central component of the culture and the ethnic identity . economy , customs . traditionally , the lowlands chechen were grain farmers and the highlanders raised sheep . at the time of russian contact the lowlands were wealthy and produced a grain surplus , while the highlands were not self-sufficient in food and traded wool and eggs for lowlands grain . chechen social structure and ethnic identity rest on principles of family and clan honor , respect for and deference to one 's elders , hospitality , formal and dignified relations between families and clans , and courteous and formal public and private behavior . kinship and clan structure are patriarchal , but women have full social and professional equality and prospects for financial independence equivalent to those of men . academics , writers , artists , and intellectuals in general are well versed in the cultures of both the european and the islamic worlds , and the society as a whole can be said to regard both of these heritages as their own together with the indigenous north caucasian artistic and intellectual tradition . social organization . until the russian conquest the chechens were an independent nation with their own language and territory but no formal political organization . villages were autonomous , as were clans . villages had mutual defense obligations in times of war , and clans had mutual support relations that linked them into larger clan confederations ( which generally coincided with dialects ) . each clan was headed by a respected elder . there were no social classes and no differences of rank apart from those of age , kinship , and earned social honor . select bibliography anonymous . 1992 . ethnic cleansing comes to russia . the economist , november 28 , 1992 , p . 60 . blanch , lesley . 1960 . the sabres of paradise . new york : viking . comrie , bernard . 1981 . the languages of the soviet union . cambridge : cambridge university press . conquest , robert . 1970 . the nation killers : the soviet deportation of nationalities . london : macmillan . critchlow , james . 1991 .

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / www . interwise . cc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully processed immediately * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

0,"more on nlp to the readers : i have recently sent out several email inquiries to various list services that i subscribe to in an attempt to learn why we do not see more software that can relate to the complexities of human grammar . that is , i was trying to learn why do n't we see better grammar checkers , more translation software , and more sophisticated language tutoring software . if there were a theory of syntax that could be programmed at all would n't there also be a swarm of programs being offered by researchers and graduate students from around the world ? would n't we be arguing about the merits of "" lfg - linguist 3 . 1 "" vs "" gb - linguist 2 . 0 . "" and would n't we be arguing about the merits of one theories labelled bracketing versus another 's ? further , other areas that might use language interfaces such as games and program internal "" help facilities "" are also quite primitive . granted , the difficulties of trying to get a program to account for pro - - blems of meaning have occupied programmers for years , but this in itself is not sufficient enough explanation for why we do not see more results in areas that require a program to exhibit a sophisticated understanding of the structure of human language . which brings me to the point of this query . to improve my understanding of this problem and perhaps to generate some meaningful dialog about this problem , i would like to propose the following list of what we should minimally expect of a program or a theory of syntax that claims to be able to handle the structure of human language . i would like to invite readers to add to the list or to point out which areas have already been adequately handled . if an area is adequately handled , i would like information on how to receive the software that is available . i divide this list into three basic areas : 1 ) minimum requirements for linguists , 2 ) minimum requirements for grammar checkers , foreign language tutoring software , and other more secular uses of syntax , and 3 ) minimum requirements for translation technology . i . minimum requirements for linguists . a program or a theory of syntax that is to be programmed must minimally be able to : 1 ) provide a full labelled bracketing of any string ( including information about intermediate and maximal level nodes ) . 2 ) provide the parts of speech of all items in a string 3 ) provide the parts of a sentence ( subject , direct object , etc ) of a string 4 ) provide acceptability judgements for sentences that can be parsed ( e . g . john1 likes himself2 is parsable but unacceptable ) . 5 ) provide judgements about topicalized sentences , fronted wh questions , tough - movement sentences , relative clauses , noun clauses , cleft and pseudo - cleft sentences , pied - piping , the complex np constraint , control sentences , parasitic gap sentences , island conditions , the that trace effect , the coreferrence requirements of pronouns and reciprocals , and strong and weak crossover effects . 6 ) perhaps provide explanations for why particular parses fail . ii . minimum requirements for grammar checkers , foreign language tutoring software , and other more secular uses of syntax . a program or theory of syntax that is to be of value in these areas should minimally : 1 ) provide information about part of speech 2 ) provide information about part of sentence ( subject , object , etc ) 3 ) provide demonstrations of grammatical constructions e . g . make passivesentences from active and active from passive , make questions from statements , join two sentences into one using a variety of conjunctions , transitions and prepositions . 4 ) provide judgements about errors in the production of sentences 5 ) provide information about types of clauses : subordinate / main , adverb , noun etc . 6 ) provide information about sentence type e . g . simple , complex , compound , etc . 7 ) analyze punctuation of words , phrases , and clauses ( including coordination ) . minimum requirements for translation technology : 1 ) provide a correct parse for the subject language and provide a grammatically correct sentence in the target language . 2 ) provide acceptability judgements and other grammar checking of sentences in both languages . 3 ) be able to do convert some sentences in both languages : e . g . statement to question , active to passive and so on . this list might be short in many ways , but i think it illustrates my point . there is a lot more that could be happening in the realm of computational syntax , but it is not happening . if i am overly pessimistic , i would like to know where i can find software that can do the above . i will post all responses to the list as a summary . also , if anyone would like to add to this list , i will keep track of the responses and post them to the list . also , if someone can explain what prevents these developments i would appreciate that as well . phil bralich bralich @ uhccux . uhcc . hawaii . edu

0,""" sycopahnt "" and "" sign of the fig "" the responses to my recent enquiry about the word "" sycophant "" and the "" sign of the fig "" were very interesting and varied . in view of this , instead of summarizing the responses i am forwarding them with minor editing : figs were first introduced in greece as expensive ( and therefore prestigious status symbols ) so that to own a fig tree was a big deal and waiting for the tree to come to fruit-bearing age and pick the fruit itself an even bigger deal . security was often low ( no electric street lights ) and so often non fig owners indulged in stealing figs ( it was probably a daredevil act too ) . so , it was decreed that anyone caught stealing figs was a crime and rewards were given to those who revealed ( phanein ) the fig ( syko ) thieves . of course , since the pilferers were probably less happy about being finked on than the fig owners , the term ' fig revealer / shower ' took on very negative connotation . it 's one thing to be steal badly and get caught ( 'd eservedly ' for botching up ) but quite another to be told on : and so goes on the lore about how sycophant came to be ( still used in modern greek , as it is in english ) but i cannot swear on its authenticity . at least that 's what we were taught in primary ( athens ) . jenny dalalakis , mcgill university , linguistics , e-mail bgbi @ musicb . mcgill . ca * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig is a highly insulting hand gesture used , so far as i know , in italy ( perhaps in other places , too . ) it is made by making a fist , with the thumb inserted between the index and middle fingers . the gesture represents th e female genitalia . a photograph of someone making the sign of the fig appears in the book gestures , a book of some ten to fifteen years ago illustrating and explaining various gestures , not just insulting ones , from a number of cul - tures . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in dante 's inferno , the sign of the fig is a sign of disrespect , in this case aimed at god ( presumably because of the forbidden apple / fig thing . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * . . . by the sign of the fig you mean a gesture , quite common in many european cultures , where you put your thumb between the first 2 fingers . originally this was symbol for sexual intercourse and therefore an obscene sign . ( "" fig "" is one of the euphemisms for the female genital . ) i know from a viennese dialect dictionary that the sign used to be current hereabouts , but it is not widely used now , whereas in italy and esp . in russia ( as to greece , i forget ) it is very current now . in russian it has lost its original obscene meaning and means simply something like "" not at all "" or "" you are pretending to work while you are not "" or "" the hell you do "" . though not indecent . . still indecent . according to barbara monahan , ( a dictionary of russian gestures ) , "" this is one of the most widely used gestures in the soviet union . . . . it is not at all indecent or vulgar . it is really the nonverbal equivalent of a very strong "" no "" . ( p . 86 ) ( among adults it can be insulting . ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the etymology of sycophant is sukon ' fig ' and phainen ' to show ' . the story is that at one time it was supposedly against the law to export figs from athens and sukophantes often turned in violators of the unpopular law for their own personal gain , these toadies being widely despised . in a word , sycophants were originally informers on fig exporters . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig , also known by its latin name , "" manus ficus "" , was and apparently still is a mediterranean equivalent of the north american "" giving the finger "" insult . it is formed by placing the thumb between the index and middle fingers of the closed , fist . interestingly , in the american manual alphabet , it is the handshape representing the letter "" t "" , but is avoided in the manual alphabets of many countries and replaced by other similar but less offensive handshapes . according to _ the hand book _ ( linda lee and james charlton , prentice - hall , 1980 ) , "" the / fica / or fig sign is an ancient copulatory gesture . here the thumb is thrust between the forefinger and the middle finger of the same hand , simulating the penis thrust through a woman 's labia . ( . . . ) it is called the / fica / or fig because the inserted thumb is about the size and shape of the fig , which , being an ancient symbol of abundance , carried with it a sense of virility and fecundity to the / mano in fica / . ( . . . ) "" ( page 70 ) . i do n't know anything about the semantic evolution of the word , but informally , i can see how the present meaning of sycophant would apply to the kind of person who would hang around on the sidelines of the action at a trial , making rude gestures at an accused , deriving the right to do so by associating him / herself with the people in power who were judging the case . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i seem to vaguely remember from my high school days that a sycophant was someone who kept an eye on the fig trees to make sure that no one stole the fruit . now , when someone was taken to court , because allegedly they had stolen figs , the sycophant would provide evidence against them by pushing aside the fig leaves and showing that some figs had been removed ! unfortunately , i cannot remember why it was a crime to cut the fruit of the fig trees ! were they intended to be offered to gods ? that could be a possible reason why they were so precious . i cann ' t remember really . . . incidentally , sycophantis in modern greek means the ' one who presents in court or in public unfounded accusations against someone ' . this probably relates to the fear of ancient athenians that someone might ' throw ' at them accusations that they would n't have been able to cope with , since a sycophant 's testimony was not to be questioned in any way . phantis in greek is an agent ; it does not mean the sign , but the person who presents something or makes something known . for example , ierophantis means someone who unravels the sacred signs of gods , i . e . a seer or prophet . modern greek has got both a verb sycopha ' nto and an abstract noun sycopha ' ntia . one last bit of ethnographic detail : it is or at least used to be common practice in greece to cut figs from trees without considering issues of who the tree / farm belongs to ! it is believed that fig trees just grow on their own without any special care and therefore do not belong to anybody . thanks for the opportunity to switch back to my mother tongue for a while ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * sykophantes ist ein verbales rektionskompositum aus "" phaino : to sukon "" ( to point at the figs ) , das zum erstenmal bei aristophanes acharner 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : sykophantes ist ein verbales rektionskompositum aus "" phaino : to su : kon "" ( to point at the figs ) , das zum erstenmal bei aristophanes , ach . 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : "" orig . used of denouncers of the attempted export of figs from athens acc . to . . . plu . solon 24 , 2 . 523b ; . . . of citizens entrusted with the collection of figs as a part of public revenues etc . . . . these and modern explanations are mere guesses .

0,"n - ary vs . binary lloyd anderson asks how n-ary ( for n greater than 2 ) comparison could ever be worse than binary . consider the problem of heads and tails when we toss coins . what are the chances of two coins ( standing for two languages obviously ) both coming up the same ( i . e . , both heads or both tails ) when tossed once ? since there are four possible outcomes of the binary toss , namely , hh , ht , tt , and th , and only two where both come up the same , the chances are 50 % . but now consider what happens when we toss three coins ( standing for three languages ) . since a coin only has two sides , in each possible outcome at least two of the coins come up the same . so the chances of 2 out of 3 coming up the same ( which would correspond to saying let two out of three languages agree in something and then they are related ) are 100 % ( which means this is not a valid test for relatedness ) . of course , if we had wanted all 3 out 3 to come up the same , then the situation would be drastically different , but in linguistics n-ary comparison never to my knowledge involves such a requirement . however , the only reason that n-ary comparison does so poorly here is that ( a ) there are only two possible outcomes per language , i . e . , languages come in only two varieties , and ( b ) the number of languages being compared is small ( only three ) . the ( a ) part is the one where real linguistic applications are drastically different from our little coin-tossing game ( since when you look for language relationships , you are looking at hundreds or thousands or maybe even more possibilities , not two , because you are looking at phonological shapes of morphemes mostly , and these allow lots of possibilities , at least thousands ) . so in the real situations that alone insures that n-ary comparison is better than binary . but it is also true that if you increase the number of coins ( languages ) in ( b ) , that also has the same effect . but you still have to be careful : the main concern is that given n languages being compared you must worry about how many out of the n are required to agree and about not making that number too small ( if you do , then again chance tends to take over ) . which raises a question : is there any published work on comparing languages which explicitly calculates these numbers ( and does it right ) ? alexis mr

0,"language and species a few posts on the subject have pleased me : i am perhaps not alone in having eccentric beliefs about non-human languages . it had started when i was hoping , after finishing my phd , to work on dolphins ' language ; it had continued when i read , somewhere , that the deaf 's sign language was not a language ( how did those people whom i saw meeting regularly in the pub down the road communicate , then , if they did not have a language ? i often envied them being stone deaf - - cursed with hearing as i am , i dislike noisy pubs and restaurants ) . a that stage , it got me thinking that "" proper "" human language dealt with encoding an n-dimensional conceptual universe into one-dimensional strings ( perhaps with a degenerate dimension extra , if you pay attention to prosodic features ) . that , sign language , on the other hand , encoded it into definitely two dimensions or more - - even though i could not figure out how many , let alone which , having found so little in the literature ( just as anyone doing linguistics should know at least a few foreign languages , perhaps , perhaps they should know at least some sign language , and have practiced it . when i say "" perhaps "" i mean "" definitely "" , of course . "" perhaps "" is a euphemism , a weak excuse for not having taken the time to learn and practice sign language ) . later , about dolphins ' languages , no * cetacean * in this case , i read , somewhere , the circumstances under which orcs had learnt to avoid boats equipped with harpoon guns , which seemed to mean that they must have been "" told "" how to recognize them by the first to meet those boats for the first time . this seemed too efficient . you just try to explain to someone how to recognize a contraption never encountered before . no paper and pencil , just words . misunderstandings galore . that got me thinking about another possible form of communication . cetaceans "" see "" by sonar , like bats . they communicate , we read , by sound , in a very wide range ( a few hertz to 100khz or more if memory serves ) . what if they actually communicated by * projecting * sonar images then ? paintings as it were , along with stylized representations . animated too , that 's quite possible . later again , i tied that in with what some will tell you about the intelligence of birds , how some mynah birds seem to understand a few words and use them in the proper context . the complexity of bird songs . the hopelessness of some schemes dreamt up to find out if animals communicated through language strikes me now . putting birds , or whatever , in different cages or pens , training one set to push the third lever from the left to get food ; see if they communicate their discovery to the those in the other pen . if they communicate by projected sonar image we are looking for the needle in the haystack . by song modulation , ditto . there would be , at any rate , dozens , nay , hundreds of ways of explaining "" push the third lever "" . how would * you * say "" lever "" if you had never had anything like it in your environment ? "" third "" ? "" from the left "" ? so even if they jabbered in a human-like language , one phoneme after the other , we would have a very hard time of spotting their exchange . you know the story about how they said "" piano "" in beach - la - mar : "" big fella box , he got black and white teeth , missus belong white master he fight ' im belong him , box he cry now "" . there 's more than one way to say "" piano "" that way ! i have , then , come to this notion that , when we meet non-human , sentient beings , we probably won't recognize the fact . that those definitions ( and redefinitions ) of language as human language with these and those features , and if it has n't got it then it is n't language , are utterly uninteresting . they would be at best entirely useless , only vacuous tautologies ( is n't that self-referencing ! ) . but in fact they can only be obnoxious , leading to methods incapable of recognizing and analyzing "" non-human "" languages . such as asl ( insert a sarcastic smiley here ) . to conclude on a related theme . i keep reading how the reconstructed vocal tract of neanderthals shows that they could not have a full language , because . . . blah blah ( i really am loath to repeat the argument ) . how about the vocal tract of a parrot , reconstructed from its skeleton ? j . guy @ trl . oz . au

"" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 's in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more ' hip ' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 's and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there 's a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 's out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 's , as rumour has it that used 501 's are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 's , what 's it all about "" 501 's are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 's are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi 's . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 's are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you ' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like "" cash for used 501 's . "" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi 's were the prestige brand ; i do n't know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . "" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal "" used 501 's are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans ' "" . witnessing a 501 deal "" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 's , with 'd eal ' meaning ' ( business ) transaction ' , or 'd eal ' could mean ' bargain ' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb ' witness ' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . "" . cowboys like their 501 's blue and stiff "" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n't wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) "" . a used - 501 deal "" i ' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for "" used 501s . "" "" 501 "" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i ' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i ' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i 'd say that a "" major used - 501 deal "" is either a transaction such as the one i ' m proposing for tomorrow or , because "" deal "" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like "" thing "" , a place of business where such transactions take place . "" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction "" "" a major used - 501 deal "" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . "" deal "" is so inarticulate a word that it 's not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to "" getting a good deal "" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n't have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( "" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business "" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone 's having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for "" a major used - 501 deal "" . 1 . "" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans "" 2 . "" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand "" 3 . "" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans "" "" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition ' to witness ' - - at least when it means ' to see sth . ' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the ' 501 deal ' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . "" can best be paraphrased into : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi 's 501 . "" if someone still feels uncomfortable with this transcription , please do n't hesitate to send your reaction to wimk @ zeus . cs . kun . nl . thanks again for all your contributions . many regards , wim koole , also on behalf of janny koole - loonstra nijmegen holland

as well as the possible contributions of the analysis of time , space and movement in language to the comprehension of the organization of the perceived objects , and to the identification of their cognitively relevant properties . contributions are invited on substantial and original research on various aspects of time , space and movement , including , but not limited to , the following . a . semantics of time , space and movement in natural language - lexical semantics : from linguistic and conceptual description to formalisation - from lexicon to sentence and discourse : role of the spatial and spatio-temporal ( s & st ) common-sense knowledge in discourse interpretation - logics and deductive mechanisms : * for the computation of the s & st reference * for the cognitive validation of discourse representations b . knowledge representation and s & st reasoning - ontology of s & st entities : philosophical analysis and formalisation - mental representations of space , time and movement - mathematics of the sensible world - naive physics , qualitative s & st reasoning - logics and visual reasoning - contributions to discourse representation c . relations between language and perception - imaginal and / or propositional structures of mental representations - from language to visual perception : from propositional to numerical structures ( image synthesis ) - from visual perception to language : from numerical to propositional structures ( image interpretation ) - mathematical and logical problems of hybrid reasoning invited speakers ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ nicholas asher , linguistics and philosophy , austin patrick blackburn , logic and computational linguistics , saarbruecken mimo caenepeel * , linguistics , edinburgh anthony cohn , artificial intelligence , leeds john etchemendy , philosophy , stanford luis farinas del cerro , logics and computer science , toulouse christian freksa * , cognitive science , hamburg christopher habel * , cognitive science , hamburg patrick hayes * , artificial intelligence , urbana gerd herzog , artificial intelligence , saarbruecken hans kamp * , linguistics and philosophy , stuttgart manfred krifka , linguistics , austin carlota smith , linguistics , austin barbara tversky * , psychology , stanford claude vandeloise , linguistics , baton - rouge achille varzi , philosophy , trento henk verkuyl , linguistics , utrecht co vet , linguistics , groningen ( * ) to be confirmed programme committee ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ chair : mario borillo , artificial intelligence , toulouse nicholas asher , linguistics and philosophy , austin patrick blackburn , logics and computational linguistics , saarbruecken andree borillo , linguistics , toulouse anthony cohn , artificial intelligence , leeds john etchemendy , philosophy , stanford patrick hayes , artificial intelligence , urbana carlota smith , linguistics , austin barbara tversky , psychology , stanford achille varzi , philosophy , trento co vet , linguistics , groningen laure vieu , artificial intelligence , toulouse format for submission ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ submitted papers should be at most 12 pages in length and be produced in 12pt ( default latex article style is ok ) . submissions should provide the affiliation , full postal address , telephone and fax numbers , and e-mail address ( if any ) of the author ( s ) . a few words stating the position of the paper with respect to the topics of interest would be useful , as well as a 100-200 word abstract . electronic submission ( plain ascii , latex , uuencoded postscript , or binhex mac word files ) is recommended . they should be sent to tsm @ irit . fr before 10 february 1995 . hard - copy submissions ( 4 copies ) should reach the programme chair no late than 10 february 1995 . notification of acceptance will be sent to authors by 10 april , 1995 , and final versions ( camera-ready ) will be due by 15 may , 1995 . these will be compiled as workshop notes to be distributed to the participants . schedule ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ papers submission . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 february , 1995 notification of acceptance . . . . . . 10 april , 1995 final version due . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 may , 1995 workshop . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23-27 june , 1995 organization ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ organizing committee : pascal amsili , irit michel aurnague , erss andree borillo , erss mario borillo , irit myriam bras - grivart , irit pierre sablayrolles , irit laure vieu , irit contact : tsm ' 95 c / o mario borillo irit - universite paul sabatier 118 , route de narbonne , f-31062 toulouse cedex france tel : ( + 33 ) 61 . 55 . 60 . 91 fax : ( + 33 ) 61 . 55 . 83 . 25 e - mail : tsm @ irit . fr www : http : / / www . irit . fr / activites / eq _ lrc / tsm95 . html

1,"dated material please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully , immediately print and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! i did n't believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters out . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just could n't believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this exactly works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying "" please put me on your mailing list "" and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other 's lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed ! ! ! ! a ) immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the seven people listed below . wrap the dollar in a note ( type or handwritten ) saying "" please add me to your mailing list "" and include your name , mailing address , and e-mail address . your phone number is optional . 1 - jal 8401 e . 60th st . # 2811 tulsa , ok 74145-5075 2 - lbm enterprises 167 hamilton st . oceanside , ca 92054 3 - s + k industries 641a puller pl san clemente , ca 92672 4 - smooth enterprises 205-38 abeyta ct , oceanside , ca 92054 5 - d&k cybermart 2281 annadale way , chula vista ca 91915 6 - arawak , 2442 n . main st . , suite 185 , gainesville , fl 32609 7 - mike m , p . o . box 89009 cp elysee , laval , quebec , h7w 5k1 b ) remove the name next to # 1 at the top of the list and move the rest of the names up on position . then place your name in the # 7 spot . this is best done by saving this to a file and enter in your information on line # 7 . be very careful when you type the addresses and proof read them . c ) when you have completed the above instructions you have options of mailing your new letter in two ways 1 ) through us postal service or 2 ) through e-mail . this letter has been proven perfectly legal for both ways as long as you follow the above instructions , because you ' re purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list . to mail this out over the internet , you could browse through areas and find people to send this to all the time . all you have to do is cut and paste e-mail addresses wherever you are on the internet . remember , it does n't cost anything to mail on the internet . or you can use a mass e-mail network to mail it out in large volumes for you . we highly recommend this one . they always e-mail more than the amount you purchase and their addresses are fresh . e - mail this letter to them with your name and address in position # 7 above . bulk email is highly recommended for ease and efficiency . newsgroups tend to be very unreliable . just do a search on the web for bulk email . * * you will want to e-mail this to as many people as you can . this will bring you big payoffs . this company has been most effective for this program . * * * keep in mind that there is no limit to the amount of names you could send out . the more names you send the more money you will make . we strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family and friends and relatives as well . * * * this is a service and is 100 % legal ! ! ! ( refer to title 18 , section 1302 & 1342 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws ) assume for example you get a 7 . 5 % return rate , which is very conservative . my first attempt was about 9 . 5 % and my second time was over 11 % 1 ) when you mail out 200 letters , 15 people will send you $ 1 . 00 2 ) those 15 people mail out 200 letters and 225 people send you $ 1 . 00 3 ) those 225 people mail out 200 letters and 3 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 4 ) those 3 , 375 people mail out 200 letters and 50 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 5 ) those 50 , 625 people mail out 200 letters and 759 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 6 ) those 759 , 375 people mail out 200 letter and 11 , 390 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 at this point your name drops off the list . think about it . with only the first six levels you have received over $ 813 , 615 . 00 ! it works every time , but how well depends on how many letters you send out . in the example above you mailed out 200 letters , if you mailed out 500 letters , you would have received over $ 2 , 006 , 917 . 00 check the math yourself , i want you to , but i guarantee it is correct ! with this kind of return , you ' ve got to try it . try it once and you will do it again - guaranteed ! just make sure you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list with a note to be added to their mailing list . together we will all prosper ! ! ! ps you ' ve read this far , so let me ask you one simple question . q - what have you got to lose a - only $ 7 . 00 what you can gain is an income , like the example in the letter . very small risk . very small expense , huge potential returns ! what do you have to lose ? i invite you to join our mailing list today ! wishing you happy success ! p . p . s . we have a 95 % return at this point ! ! !

0,"currency names - summary months ago i sent a question out on the linguist list about some currency names . i got a number of responses , but being both lazy and busy , it has taken me much too long to send out a summary . but now , for those who have - - maybe - - been waiting for it , here it comes . i will not say anything about the scientific value of it , but interesting is it ( it might e . g . be , that all the "" r . . . l "" words are "" after f [ rench ] ( and sp [ anish ] ) models and are indeed cognate with royal "" , and the rupee and the rubl are not related to either the "" r . . . l "" words or each other at all ) . - - i have somewhat shortened the responses , where necessary . veturlidi oskarsson veturosk @ ismal . hi . is - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the request as it was sent on march 27 , 1995 : > does anybody know the etymology of the following currency names : > rial ( iran , oman , north yemen ) > riyal ( saudi arabia , quatar ) > riel ( cambodia ) > real ( brazil ) > and maybe other similar names beginning with ri / re end ending with l ? > would it be possible that those names are of the same ( ie . ) origin , > originally refering to kingdom e . t . c . ( cf . regal ) ? > ( what about the russian _ rubel _ , and the _ rupee _ in india e . t . c . ? ) > it would , in fact , not have to be that strange to have a currency name > of the same origin in countries as far away from each other as brazil > and cambodia , as currency names do not seem to > follow any "" national "" > rules . > cf . the name _ dollar _ ( in use in almost 60 countries ( comes originally > from the german _ thaler _ , but has supposedly spread out under the > influence of usd ) ) , and the many variations of the word "" crown "" > ( icelandic kr / ona , danish krone , estonian kroon , czechish korun e . t . c ) , > and _ dinar _ in various ( arabic ) countries . > veturlidi oskarsson > icelandic language institute reykjavik , iceland > e-mail : veturosk @ ismal . hi . is 1 . response : "" real "" ( brazil ) is certainly from latin , meaning "" the king 's money "" . i would bet the other r . . . l words are unrelated , although i can't give etymologies for them . - - note that "" dinar "" is actually of latin origin ( denarius ) , via greek . john cowan 2 . response : spanish and portuguese "" real "" mean "" royal "" ( the king 's currency ) . i have no idea whether this got picked up into arabic and cambodian as "" riyal "" etc . - - sanskrit "" rupaya "" ( "" rupee "" ) is different although at the moment i can't recall what it means . michael a . covington the university of georgia , usa 3 . response : the czech currency unit ( "" crown "" in english ) is called "" koruna "" in the nominative singular . the form you gave , "" korun "" , with a long / u / is the genetive plural form , which has a zero ending and is used with numbers over 5 . therefore you get "" 1 koruna "" , "" 2 koruny "" , but "" 5 korun "" . the german word "" thaler "" ( whence "" dollar "" ) comes from an earlier word "" joachimsthaler "" , which designated a coin minted from the high-quality silver mined during the middle ages at the town of joachimsthal ( "" thal "" = valley ) , which now bears the czech name jachimov . jachimov is in the west bohemian region of the czech republic . james kirchner 4 . response : the russian word * rubl ' * is not related to * real * , * rial * , etc . the word is an old past passive participle ( "" l-participle "" ) of the verb * rubit ' * ' to chop . ' gold ingots were originally * chopped * into small ( eventually , circular ) pieces and used as coins . in contemporary russian , the past passive participle of this verb is * rublennyj * ( e . g . , * rublennoe mjaso * ' chopped meat ' ) . gary h . toops wichita state university 5 . response : "" real "" in portuguese / spanish is cognate with "" royal "" and "" regal . "" my hunch is because it was currency backed by the crown , but it 's a hunch . it would be interesting to be able to do something like prove that the spanish / portuguese used the term ' real , ' which was picked up by the moors and carried with islamic invaders into se asia . also difficult . the russian "" rubl ' "" is a bit more than a hunch - - it derives from the word for "" cut "" : rubit ' ' to cut ' , and other words . check out fasmer 's ( vasmer 's ) etymological dictionary , available in german or russian . i was told by a slavic professor that this is cognate to "" rupee , "" but the guy was going around the bend and could easily be wrong on that point . t . beasley ucla 6 . response : the rial words are all originally "" after f [ rench ] ( and sp [ anish ] ) models "" and are indeed cognate with royal . in england a gold coin of this name was issued in 1465 , and there were french , spanish and scottish coins of the same name over the 15 and 16c . the name seems to have travelled with the maritime empires . dollar also has a complicated history . starting as the english version of thaler ( a coin of the german states ) it then was used for the large spanish coin ( worth 8 reales ) of spain . because of the importance of the spanish maritime influence and of its currency , the term became very widespread and was used ( even in parts of the british empire , such as the straits settlements - - we still use dollars here in singapore ) in many places , including in the us . you cannot assume that the use of dollar is a sign of american influence . rupee is different , coming from a sanskrit word for silver , it is of indian origin . anthea fraser national university of singapore 7 . response : according to vasmer 's etymological dictionary of russian , rubl ' ( gen . sg . rublj ' a ( stress on ending ) ) shares a root with the verb rubit ' ' hack ' and meant ' hacked off piece of a grivna ( larger unit of currency ) ' . gladney 8 . response : russian rubl ' is not related to rial / real . it comes from a root meaning ' cut ' . the origin of the term is from silver bars from which sections were clipped off ( otrubit ' in russian ) and used as currency . i remember visiting a church in moscow dedicated to the ' cut-off head of john the baptist ' ( otrublennoj golove ioanna predtechy ) . btw kopejka ( 1 \ 100 of a rubl ' ) means 's mall spear / lance ' and comes from the depiction of st . george killing the dragon which was the symbol printed on it . the russian word for money - 'd en ' gi ' - is of turkic origin and is one of several in the russian language coming from a turkic root meaning 's tamp ' . incidentally , i ' m pleased to see that the slovenian currency is the toler - one more from dollar . geraint jennings 9 . response : panamanians use the term real for a 5 centavo piece . it was interesting to me because the currency is in balboas & centavos , but , as with american money , this coin had its own name . as far as i know , it was the only coin that had its own name ( i lived there for 11 years ) . it was also a type of test in the marketplace to determine who was "" local "" & who was n't . when the price quoted to me was "" 2 reales "" & i pulled out the exact change , they knew i was n't a tourist ! the word real means royal in spanish , but i do n't know why the 5 centavo piece would be called such . caroline l . steele university of hawaii 10 . response : according to klein ' s comprehensive etymological dictionary of the english language , * rial * , * riyal * are from spanish * real * ( < latin regalem ) to which portuguese * real * is obviously related . i have no info on * riel * . the russian * ruble * and indian * rupee * are not related to the above nor to each other . they both come from indigenous words . marc picard 11 . response : according to the macmillan dictionary of measurement , the first real ( ` royal ' ) was a small silver coin issued by the spanish royal mint . rupya ( > rupee ) is an ancient indian word for ` ( metal made into ) coinage ' , and ruble may be related . dinar comes from latin denarius , a coin worth ten asses ( a word related to ace ) . anton sherwood 12 . response : . . . "" real "" was also the name of a old gold or silver coin in the kingdoms of castile , portugal and aragon ( later in spanish america ) . the first dated ' real ' was coined in castile in the middle of the 14th century . they were called ' real ' because they were coined by the crown , in opposition to local coins coined by bishops , counts and noblemen . according to my sources of information ( enciclopedia larousse - spanish version ) , there were ' reals ' in france too . in the 14th century , the iberian peninsula was divided in several territories : three christian kingdoms : castile , aragon and portugal , and a lot of small moorish kingdoms ( called ' taifas ' ) . it is not unlikely , thus , that the name for the ' real ' had been taken in arabic as ' riyal ' . one curiosity : in contemporary spanish , the sentence ' no tengo un real ' ( literally : i have not a real ) means ' i have not a dime ' ( the same in catalan : no tinc un ral ' ) . j . carlos ruiz universitat jaume i castells 13 . response : in the case of brazil 's real , the currency is named after an old currency which was always referred to in the plural as ' reis ' and ' mirreis ' ( thousands ) . ' real ' means ' royal ' , and so does ' reis ' , i suppose . tony berber sardinha university of liverpool 14 . response : ( translated from icelandic : ) the russian word rubl is in no way related to the "" r . . . l "" currencies . in russian the word is _ rubl ' _ ( ' = palatalization ) , and comes from the verb _ rubit ' _ ' chop , hew ' . the explanation is , as far as i know , that the coin was minted by punching it from a metal plate with a special puncher or stamping iron . the "" l "" is not a suffix , as one could expect , but come from * bj , * mj etc . ( labial cons . + j ) , that changed to * bl ' , * ml ' etc . in proto slavic . so , it is ie . * roubh-jo - s , or something like that , that lies behind the rubl . i do n't know about the arabian word _ ri ( y ) al _ ( which i suspect to have a long a : ) . it could very well be of semitic origin , both the number and and type of root consonants ( r-y - l ) , and "" cv - type "" ( cvcvvc , cf . kita : b ' book ' ) could support that . gunnar ol . hansson 15 . response : hinds and badawi 's dict . of egyptian arabic ( 1986 ) indicates that riyaal , twenty piastres or a twenty-piastre piece , derives from spanish real . kirk belnap brigham young university 16 . response : as far as i , as a layperson , know , the word "" real "" in continental spanish was in fact in use until the begining of the 20th century ( my grandmothers used it , as well as my father , in everyday speech ) . i am not sure what portion of a peseta this amount was ( whether it was a portion of a cent or viceversa , i could ask if you want to know ) . i suspect that , at least the word real in portuguese ( or brazilian ) comes from the spanish one , and as you know , the spanish ' real ' means of course ' royal ' . nuria lopez ortega cornell university - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - thank you all . veturlidi oskarsson

1,"hi ! * * * this is not spam ! * * * my name is matthew . i make a habit of deleting mail i have not yet read , as i ' m sure you do also . please read this one though , you might find this interesting . i recently lost my high paying job from a major computer corporation due to their loss of a major contract . they messed up , but that whole dep ' t of 15 people including myself are hung out to dry . corporate america at it 's finest . i have not had luck yet finding another job , as my skills were very specific to that company and not really worth anything to another company . during the time i worked there , i also bought and sold real estate like those guys on tv . ( yes , you can do that and make it work for you too ) the key is i made it work . i was fairly successful until the "" nightmare on pleasant st . "" as my friends and i call it . . . i lost most of my money in that one bad deal and i was no longer financially secure and i relied heavily on my income from my former job . as you ' ve already heard , i lost that too and i started to look for other things i could make money to help me get back on my feet . so , i started to read all of the junk that people have mailed to me . let me tell you , i can't believe some of the things out there . . . what a waste of time . until i saw this . hold on . i know you are ( like i was ) ready to stop reading right here . i implore you not to . i ( like you ) am not some non-educated fool . i have made much money for myself in real estate , which is not an easy business . i am a rather competent business man . at least finish reading this until the end . * * better still : print this letter and read it in comfort over , and over here is what i saw . . . * i only needed $ 20 extra dollars to try this * this is making money for people who at least tried a little , so why not me too ? in desparation , i sent the four 5 dollar bills and got the reports . as i always have , i made this work for me too . i took much time and effort to learn about e-mail ( which is a great and free tool ! ! ) and how to send lots of it . now , 19 days after my first mailing of this , i have received roughly 8 , 450 responses .

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately

0,"help : teaching stress in intro phonetics does anybody have any hints on how to help undergrads in an introductory phonetics class learn to hear lexical stress ( that is , to identify the syllable in a word that receives primary stress ) , particulary in ameng ? the two "" helps "" i know are 1 ) say the word several times , over-emphasizing one syllable at a time ( i ' ve just done this by example , using extreme f0 & intensity variation ) . one production should sound reasonably normal and the rest should sound pretty odd ; or 2 ) tap your finger as you say the word ; folks usually tap on the stressed syllable . while most students i ' ve had seem to grasp this fairly quickly , i still have a few who , after numerous examples , look at me as if i ' m being utterly mystical . some of these are non-native speakers of english , but not all . i realize that this question calls up all sorts of issues on the nature of stress and its perception , but before one can address those at all it 's necessary to introduce the concept somehow , and so far my experience has been that introductory discussions of stress in phonetics texts ultimately assume that speakers can pretty reliably "" hear stress "" once the phenomenon is pointed out to them - - that is , that there 's something intuitively obvious about the notion of a stressed syllable . but what about those students / speakers who apparently find nothing intuitive about it ? thanks laura l . koenig ( koenig @ haskins . yale . edu )

0,"phonemicity of writing i would like to get some estimate of what percentage of the world 's written languages are represented orthographically in a phonemic manner . more specifically , how many written languages are such that one can predict the phonological properties of a word - - - including stress , accent or tone - - - merely by consulting the string of symbols used to write that word , and without further information , such as the morphological structure of the word ? for a language whose writing system is largely phonemic , one could write down a set of rules for word pronunciation , and in the ideal case the number of rules would be within an order of magnitude of the number of graphemes . ( a few lexical exceptions do n't matter , as long as there are n't hundreds of them . ) i am leaving the sense of ` phoneme ' intentionally vague : normally a phonemic written representation implies that one can predict the surface phonemic representation from the written form of the word , but i would be perfectly happy considering a system to be phonemic if some more abstract level of phonological representation were represented , from which the surface phonemic representation could be predicted by regular phonological rules / principles . ( i should also note , to clarify the question further , that i am interested primarily in the correspondence between the written form and the spoken form for the the standard variet ( y , ies ) of the language , which the written form presumably reflects to some degree : i am not interested ( at the moment ) in dialects of the language which deviate to varying degrees from the standard . ) so , under this definition , spanish would presumably count as very phonemic since one can nearly always predict the pronunciation of a word , including its stress , from the orthography . romanian is less phonemic since while the actual set of phonemes in a word is mostly determinable by the set of graphemes used ( with the representation of glides being slight source of complication ) , the placement of stress requires some knowledge of the morphological class of the word ( following work of ioana chitoran ) . english is presumably among the least phonemic , since the ` regular rules ' of pronunciation are themselves quite complex , and there are many lexical exceptions . the particular classification of the writing system as logographic , moraic or segmental is unimportant : in principle chinese writing could be classed as phonemic ( albeit with a rather large set of graphemes ) , but for the fact that especially among the more common characters there are quite a few with pronunciation ambiguities which can only be resolved using lexical information . i am familiar with several of the recent books on writing systems : but while these typically contain in-depth analyses of particular systems , as far as i can tell , nobody has done a survey of this kind . ( if on the contrary , someone can point me to a survey that answers this question , i would be most grateful . ) so , i would be very interested in getting as much information related to this question on as many languages as people are sufficiently familiar with . i think i already know the answer to these questions for the more familiar western european languages ( including some less familiar ones like irish and welsh ) , as well as romanian , russian , hebrew , arabic , chinese , japanese and malagasy . i would be particularly interested in knowing about languages for which writing systems have only recently been developed , or for which the spelling system has recently undergone a massive restructuring : conventional wisdom has it that in such cases the writing system should be very phonemic , but perhaps that is not always true . please send any replies to me , and if there are a sufficient number i will post the results of this survey to the list . - richard sproat linguistics research department at&t bell laboratories | tel ( 908 ) 582-5296 600 mountain avenue , room 2d - 451 | fax ( 908 ) 582-7308 murray hill , nj 07974 , usa | rws @ research . att . com

"" mistakes "" which the author made ( statements which would render the text less valuable for comparative philosophy ) are tacitly "" corrected "" ( read : deleted ) , terminology is adjusted etc . - this phenomenon itself is grounded in the personal union of translator and historician , translator and interpreter , translator and commentator . while a translation of a novel can be done by one person , who is a translator in a more technical sense , and can be thoroughly researched in its historical impact by somebody else , who is a literature-historian , this is not only uncommon in the field of comparative philosophy ( or the study of other cultures ' philosophies ) , but also hardly feasible - for in most cases , even the philological constitution of the texts in question has to be informed by the interpretation . this results in a quite difficult ( and peculiar ) position of translation in the whole hermeneutical process - in most cases , the translation will serve as a "" second-language "" - commentary to the translated texts , not presenting an otherwise inaccessible philosophical text in its own right to those who do not understand the source-language , but a ) justifying the constitution of the text , b ) clarifying the interpretation on part of the translator and c ) ( see above ) justifying the project of translation for those who not only do understand the source-language , but who are already basically familiar with the historical and philosophical environment . in this context , translation loses much of its "" mediating "" function between two languages , but becomes a tool of explanation , which , in some contexts , can even be dismissed with ( i have seen and heard many specialists in indian philosophy whose explanations are basically made up of sanskrit terms , only vaguely connected by english copula ) . while this can naturally be explained on account of different target audiences ( translations for specialists will be different from translations for non-specialists ) , i find that this different function of translation is not recognized within the "" specialists ' "" group at all . in other words : criteria which would apply to judging a translation in a broader context ( e . g . a translation of a novel ) are applied to translations which are carried out in this specific context , without even considering a possible difference in the pragmatic environment . i would thoroughly appreciate any opinions on this , birgit kellner institute for indian philosophy university of hiroshima

0,"disc . sex / lang i have been proceeding with a "" disc he / she "" theme . it has been somewhat expanded , and i would like to have it posted under the "" disc : sex / lang "" subject head . thanks , jw ] in the continuing discussion of pronouns , i ' m making a summary and a shift . the shift is spurred by the necessity to widen the orbit from pronouns to "" sex and language "" , perhaps an inevitable transition . alexis manaster ramer ( see below ) has suggested that a discussion of universal male dominace in society / language should take place prior to one of pronouns . i willingly go along , but reject the misandrist characterization . first the pronoun summary . "" he "" summary in my "" he "" work , i have suggested that to understand the generic and proverbial uses of modern english "" he "" , one would have to integrate into their data the facts that 1 ) "" he "" as a feminine pronoun survived much later in historical english than is generally acknowledged , and that 2 ) the late-archaic english "" he "" , on the one hand , as feminine , had an association with the all-genders plural , and on the other , as a masculine , had an association with the singular and neuter . "" him "" and "" his "" were during middle english , and later , also neuter ( "" not one or the other "" ) pronouns , and the ontogeny of the modern paradigm must account for these facts . there are more than a few examples of "" he "" in a generic / proverbial context in which , if there is any sex distinction at all , it must be considered feminine , not masculine , as in the following ( _ piers plowman _ , walter kane - - passus vii , manuscript h3 , lines 235-36 ) : he that etyn here fode throw trauail god 3eueth they / she that eat / eats their / her food through work god gives hem his blissing that here liflode so wynneth them his blessing that their / her livelihood so earns . _ _ _ when the 18th century grammarians put the "" he "" rule on paper , the feminine morphology was not unknown , not yet forgotten . if gender feminists today put a gendrist interpretation on the grammarians ' motives and on the evolution of the "" he "" rule , it is through historical oversight , to put it kindly , and not for , as some maintain , misogynist motives , conscious or unconscious . finally , i have challenged the interpretation of the "" worthiness "" doctrine . according to it , the grammarians of yore said "" he "" was more "" worthy "" . the word "" worthy "" has , i believe , been too quickly accepted in its old english root-meaning of "" deserving "" , whereas i have yet to see any contexts that contradict its other meaning , based on its other old english root , "" appropriate "" . are there any clarifying contexts ? please show i ' m wrong . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sex and language alexis manaster ramer sent me a personal response to my ideas ; when i asked , he said i could post for general reading . ( btw , what are some of the etymologies given for "" girl "" , "" boy "" , "" marry "" ? ) alexis says : thank you for responding . since we obviously agree about the final resolution of this issue , i guess i would say that there are simply two aspects to the way one must respond to the people who are claiming that the generic he was invented by male chauvinist grammarians . one is yours ( that it has a continuous history within english ) [ did i say that ? - jw ] . the other is mine ( that if we knew nothing about the history of english , the universal picture would authorize us to suppose that this was indeed a natural phenomenon , not an invention of the grammarians ) . but i would then say that the presumed reason why this phenomenon is universal is presumably that all known cultures ( or maybe there is one exception , according to what i read somewhere ) have been male-dominated at all known time periods , and the fact that masculine / male is ' unmarked ' must surely be a reflection of this . so , the locus of the blame [ ! ] shifts from the conscious work of english grammarians to the subconscious workings of the language faculties of countless generations of human beings all over the planet who have lived in societies where there was no concept of sex equality . what do you think ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff responds thanks for the elaboration . what do i think ? first , to get it straight . . . you are saying that comparable structures to "" generic he "" are found in all languages ( with perhaps a few exceptions ) , and on that basis a person might be led to conclude it is a natural phenomenon , but they would be wrong . rather , universal male domination is the explanation , as seen in the unmarked pronoun "" he "" , and we must "" blame "" the subconscious workings of the language faculties of all people in history , who have had no concept of sex equality . i have three questions , each of which i provide some of my own views about . 1 ) what are some of the parameters of and who ( authors ) do you look to for your idea that all history has been male dominated ? ( i personally resent this characterization . ) "" dominated "" hinges on what you mean - - the crimson sunset dominated the horizon and the pimples dominated the young girl 's face . on a group level , men , qua males , have been sufficiently dutiful to "" women and children first "" that they can be said to have historically regarded their own lot as the more expendable , i . e . , at least as might say the contour of a bell-curve measuring such a thing . men subdue the metaphorical colin fergusons of the world , not women . on an individual level , camille paglia nails it when she talks about the substantial power of women over men , qua males , based on women 's power to close their legs . 2 ) where does your concept of linguistic markedness come from , and on what basis do you establish a cause-effect relationship between patriarchy and markedness in pronouns ? my own idea of markedness is based on the original exposition as seen formulated by jakobson and trubetzkoy about 1930 ( see _ on language _ , roman jakobson , ed . linda r . waugh , 1990 . chapter 8 ) . a conclusion opposite to yours ( and gender feminists ) seems evident from the original formulation . their concept of "" the mark "" grew out of interest in binary aspects of language , like past / present , long / short . trubetzkoy wrote , "" only one of the terms of a correlation is perceived as actively modified and as positively possessing some mark , while the other term is perceived as lacking the mark and as passively unmodified "" ( p136 ) . this suggests to me that "" woman "" and "" she "" are "" species "" terms which females "" have "" as an exclusive and special privilege , whereas males do not have a "" species "" name exclusively their own , but instead must suffer to share a "" genus "" designation . it is for this reason i prefer sometimes to call the masculine unmarked words "" tautonyms "" ( i . e . , in biology , one name for both species and genus ) . the editor of the book goes on to comment on the concept : "" thus , the general meaning of _ lion _ , in contradistinction to that of _ lioness _ , implies no sexual specification - - and only the * basic meaning * of _ lion _ prompted by informative contexts suggests a sexual specification : e . g . , _ lions and lionesses _ "" . is n't this saying that man qua male emerges only in contexts that contrast him with the female ? otherwise , he is a generic ( genus , genre ) person and accordingly unmarked - - i . e . , "" just "" a person . the jakobson book continues , "" the constraining , focusing character of the marked term of any grammatical opposition is directed toward a more narrowly specified and delimited conceptual item "" . if men wanted to throw a testy beef about it , they could say , "" how come the gals have exclusive words , but the guys have to share theirs with everybody else ? "" 3 ) finally , you propose that in all past history they ' ve had "" no concept of sex equality "" . there is an inherent chronocentrism ( my term ) in your indictment , but , notwithstanding , i ' m somewhat sure you ' re talking about "" rights "" . "" rights "" , equal or otherwise , is a modern concept that is often muddled and sometimes useless if one considers , as i do , that the more important ends of life are happiness , inner peace , and freedom from fear - - what good are abstract rights if one is miserable all the time ? . the extremely important distinction is too often lost sight of between concepts of inherent rights and entitlement rights . if we discuss "" women 's equality "" and "" men 's equality "" without talking about documents like the universal declaration of human rights , the united states constitution , the code of hammurabi , etc . , or sources of rights , like god or the barrel of a gun , we are not going to get anywhere . if we take into account considerations of class , age , history , geography , etc . , i would argue that on a de facto level , women have had , and continue to have , collectively , an advantage over men . i know that saying so will upset a few of us , even give some of us a little gas and heartburn , my being the direct precipitation of which i apologize for in advance . best regards , jeffrey

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately

0,"antipassive and reflexive some time ago , i posted a question asking whether people knew of languages that had both a reflexive morpheme ( attached to v ) and an antipassive morpheme ( attached to v ) , where the two were different . i received three replies which are included below in abbreviated form . i thank those who responded for their help : angela terrill , mike darnell , and suzanne kemmer * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * there are thirteen or so australian languages which have antipassives ( all pama - nyungan ) . of these , most use the same morphology as their reflexives . some languages have antipassive verbal morphology but no reflexive morphology . but the languages which have separate explicit verbal morphology for reflexives and antipassives are , including sources : * dyirbal ( around cairns ) marks antipassive with - ngay - . reflexive is rriy ~ yirriy ~ marriy ~ ( m ) barriy . dixon ( 1972 ) the dyirbal language of north queensland ( cambridge : cup ) * warungu ( west of dyirbal , not closely related ) has antipassive - gali - and reflexive - li - . probably historically related . t . tsunoda ( 1974 ) ' a grammar of the warungu language ' monash university ma thesis * kalkatungu ( western queensland ) has antipassive - yi - and reflexive - ti - . maybe historically related . b . j . blake ( 1979 ) a kalkatungu grammar ( canberra : pacific linguistics ) the proto - pama - nyungan ( and maybe proto - australian ? ) reflexive form is something like * - dhi - rri - , where dh is a laminal stop , either lamino-palatal or lamino-dental . the overwhelming majority of reflexive ( and antipassive ) markers in pama - nyungan languages are reflexes of this . the warungu and kalkatungu antipassive forms given above are probably reflexes of this also , but the dyirbal form definitely is n't ( although , interestingly , it is cognate with an applicative form in nearby yidiny ( dixon 1977 ) . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * does this work for you ? lix-t - 0 - as ta sitn put . dowm-trans - 3sgo - 3sga art basket he / she put down the basket . lix-m - 0 t-ta sitn put . down-intrans - 3sgs oblique case-art basket he / she put down the basket . now admittedly there are some complexities to this situation . some salish anists ( the examples from squamish , british columbia ) dispute the antipassive analysis in the second example , but putting that aside payaq-t - sut prepare-trans - reflexive he / she prepared himself / herself . this seems to fit your requirements , but i have a question . could the morpheme in your example , and perhaps in the case of others that you mention in passing , be a middle voice marker rather than reflexive . again , from squamish suk ' w-um ( the - um here is identical to the - m above ) bathe-intrans he / she bathes ( only himself or herself , a transitive reading requires the - - t , you saw above ) whatever the case with the examples that you ' ve seen squamish seems to have a morpheme for antipassive and middle , with a separate one for reflexive . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * a number of philippine languages have an antipassive that consists in detransitivizing the verb with a prefix and stripping the object of its 'd eterminer ' ( which marks case ) and other modifiers . the reflexive marker , on the other hand , is a completely different morpheme . kapampangan is a language of this type . another case , i would suggest , is languages whose former reflexive marker now codes antipassive , but which in the meantime have innovated a new reflexive marker . russian uses the suffix ' - sja ' on the verb ' bite ' to mean ' the dog bites ' ( generically ) and similar cases . but - sja is not the reflexive marker in russian . sebja is the productive reflexive marker . - sja does occur on verbs like ' wash ' , but these are not reflexive verbs - - languages tend to mark them differently from reflexives . my book "" the middle voice "" draws the reflexive-middle distinction and documents it from many languages . jeff lidz university of delaware office : ( 302 ) 831-6489 department of linguistics home : ( 302 ) 656-1902 46 e . delaware ave . email : jlidz @ brahms . udel . edu newark , de 19716

i do believe that many traditions ( sexism being one of them ) and perspectives are partially conveyed through language . however , like you , i tend to believe that language and behavior evolve together . i do believe that historically today 's sexist interactive patterns are influenced - - among other factors - - by sociolinguistic practices during biblical times when a wife had to address her husband as slaves had to address their master , or subjects their king . this implied that a man could also address his wife as a master his slave and a king his subject , i . e . , using a clear rhetoric of authority . today , conversational dominance by males in our judeo-christian society is not as extreme as during the biblical times , but interestingly it is still inherent to male-specific discourse and has become the focus of some interesting sociolinguistic research . as a matter of fact , i moved to the bible belt one year ago ( i spent 10 years on the east and west coasts in the us prior to my arrival in the bible belt last year ; originally i come from europe ) , and after observations of interractive patterns among couples around me , i came to the hypothesis that the stronger a religious ( or traditional ) impact on people 's life , the more sex discrimination is reflected in language use . i have also noticed much more instances of sex discrimination in language use in offices i had to go to in the bible belt ( e . g . doctor and lawyer offices , insurance agencies , etc . ) than in other professional offices i visited elsewhere in the u . s . i found this extremely interesting . > ( a ) i do believe that people in all kinds of cultures themselves > believe that men and male behavior are superior in some sense to > women and female behavior , and i hold that this perception ( even if > it were not accurate ) is what must matter to us as we discuss > sexist language . whether the perception is accurate is of no importance > in this context . why should it be of no importance ? shall we just accept the discriminatory status quo as it is ? what is the point of studying linguistics if it is for no other purpose than the pleasure of intellectual analysis ? shall we just remain at the analytical level and ignore the implications revealed by research , or could we also use research findings to help improve communication or even change subsconsciously ( socially ) acquired schemata ? studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic "" he "" retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural . obviously , the impact of using a sexist language goes beyond the simple interest of linguistic studies within a certain context . personally , i like to believe that my research will somewhat help society at large . what is the point of considering discriminatory perspectives as unchangeable or questionable facts whereas we all know that both languages and human psychology have the potential to change ? > ( b ) i do not make any necessary connection between oppression of > womn and oppression of black people at all . i simply used the > example of black slavery as an example of the general principle that > to admit the existence of a form of oppression practiced by some > group ( by white people ) does not mean that one must necessarily > hate them . my point was that i am not a mysandrist just because > i accept that men have historically not been very nice to women . you are absolutely right ! hate does not help any purpose nor does it improve communication . yet , black people needed the cooperation of open-minded white people to help them reach a status based on the principle of equality . the same applies to females who keep trying to communicate with males , and who meet open and understanding men whereas others still believe that sexism is a nonsense political issue brought up by angry feminists . before being a political issue , it is a serious social issue that needs to be addressed through mutual understanding and respect . if males refuse their cooperation , some females may end up hating men as a natural psychological reaction . simone de beauvoir wrote in her book the second sex that there is no black problem yet a white problem ( referring the civil right movement in the us in the 50 's 60 's ) , because so called black issues essentially stem from the whites ' disciminatory attitudes . black problems can be addressed by first revealing the problem of racism , and then by educating people to open their mind to differences as an enriching asset to the society , not a sign of deficiency . likewise , women issues are primarily men issues , because we are still living in a world which has been historically organized by men who believed in female inferiority , whether politically , socially or linguistically . communication between men and women is therefore the key to social improvement , hence the social mission of our research in linguistics , considering that language use is a social phenomenon . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * je pense donc je baragouine . . . . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * lydie e . meunier / department of languages university of tulsa / tel : 918 631 2813 ( o ) lang _ lem @ centum . utulsa . edu / fax : 918 744 1902 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

1,"a great business opportunity just for you ! hello ! about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , "" ok , i give in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . "" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investmentand the income return is tremendous ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 in less than 90 days ! please read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the "" internet "" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now !

0,"re : 5 . 1500 comparative method , polarization & reviews i am forwarding the following for posting at the request of robert rankin ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . unkans . edu ) . i do not subscribe to this list and have no wish to join the fray at present , but when my name is mentioned sometimes the file is forwarded to me via e-mail . thus the following : andy anderson cites me on three points in a series of recent postings . i have known andy upwards of 30 years and do not feel that he would in - tentionally misrepresent my views , but i also feel a couple of things need clarification . first , i am uncomfortable about being formally cited as a ( secondary ) source of information on lyle campbell 's paper from the boulder ( green - berg ) conference of ca . 1990 . if andy wishes to distribute an attack on the paper or its author in written form , he should first obtain an actual copy of it or , alternatively , await its publication . i guess i should n't have brought it up in our conversation at the ssila / aaa meetings . second , i am said to have reported that the geneticists who have studied the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of sundry native american and siberian peo - ples claim that there were / are "" two subgroups within amerind ( aside from the eskimo and athabaskans ) . "" this is not what i ( or the paper 's authors wallace , torroni and schurr , et al . ) said . the authors did not address themselves to the linguistic problems and most certainly did n't talk about "" subgroups "" . nor did i , since i do not regard the historicity of anything like "" amerind "" as even remotely established . the authors of the paper did posit at least four "" migrations "" . they do not discuss the most recent , eskomo - aleut , in their abstract , but i think they gave a time depth figure of about 6000 years bp ( before present ) for it orally - - do n't quote me . from their abstract : for what they call na - dene their figure is 7000-10000 years bp . then they say they have evidence for at least two "" migrations "" preceding that . one comes between 12000-15000 bp and the earliest between 26000-34000 bp . figures as high as 40000 bp were mentioned orally , as i recall . they did not attempt to correlate their figures with our knowledge of periods of glaciation or the periodic existence of the land bridge in beringia . i leave it to readers to decide what this portends for the amerind hypo - thesis or its proposed ( glotto ) chronology , but a warning is in order in any event . note that i have written "" migration "" in quotes above . this is not because i wish to pejorate the term ; it is because geneticists use it in a very special way . for them it has to do solely with the ap - pearance of specific genetic material in american populations . they then assume a common ancestor and calculate the number of millennia by positing a uniform mutation rate for mtdna . the material and theories they work with force this definition of migration on them . all this says nothing about the situation "" on the ground . "" in reality though , each of these genetic migrations can have included many distinct movements of people across beringia over a great many years - - perhaps centuries or even millennia . and they may have represented many ling - guistic groups . all that is required in order for entire clusters of migrations "" on the ground "" to get read as a single mtdna "" migration "" is a relatively homogeneous gene pool in eastern siberia over the particular time span when the "" genetic mutation "" occurred . the evidence does indeed suggest four genetic migrations , but it really says little or nothing about how many "" real "" migrations there were with - in each of the four clusters , nor does it say anything about linguistic diversity - - much less "" subgroups of amerind . "" we may wish it did , but it does n't . i do note with interest however the rough correlation between the geneticists ' oldest figures and the calculations of nichols ( 1990 in language 66 . 3 ) based on linguistic diversity in the western hemisphere . the more recent sets of mtdna dates fall within the esta - blished archaeological ballpark for clovis believers , although the earliest set certainly does not . one very short contribution of my own here - - mostly my wife 's actually , since she is a molecular geneticist and we talk about these things over breakfast . the yardstick used by mtdna geneticists in these cal - culations may not be appreciably better than that used in glottochrono - logy , i . e . , genetic mutation takes place at a rate which is only rela - tively constant . it can be speeded up by various singular events from cosmic ray bombardment to ingesting certain fungi infecting the grain from your cache pit . biologists try to allow for this sort of thing , but as you can see from the plus / minus dates for each cluster , we are not talking about something as precise as dendrochronology or even radiocarbon dating . the mtdna studies are very interesting but we must bear in mind their limitations and special use of the term "" migration "" . lastly , in an earlier posting andy mentions that i had examined green - berg 's notebooks and determined how he had mislabeled so much of his siouan data in lia . andy 's description of the way the notebooks are laid out is correct , but i have only actually seen xeroxes of the pages of siouan entries , not the notebooks themselves . i might add that the siouan entries in the notebook are hard by the iroquoian , caddoan , yuchi entries demonstrating once again that greenberg had decided on the final classification of these families when he laid out his notebook design and before the vocabularies from the languages were entered . my thanks to john koontz for posting this . sincerely , bob rankin ( university of kansas ) ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . ukans . edu )

( i ) put the stars around "" in the same way "" because one can easily distort ) someone else 's methods . ) as i understand it , some people have tried ) applying greenberg 's method to one amerindian language and one other ) language ( finnish was one such , i believe ) , but i have never heard of a ) large-scale comparison being done in this way . ( and i believe greenberg ) says his method is best used for mass comparison , not one-on - one . ) ) here we go again . some bean counter some day will tot up the number of times "" greenberg "" occurs here and will rate the corresponding work as "" highly influential "" . never mind . there is no difference between mass comparison and pair comparison . when you engage in mass comparison you carry out a large number of pair comparisons . the greater the number of comparisons , the more chances you have of finding cognates . . and chance resemblances . take two dice and roll them . how often will they show the same score ? take a bagful of them and empty it onto the floor . matches galore . but that does not matter . we ' ve had recently a long , long , exchange on the comparative method , in which alexis manaster ramer made a point - - which he seemed to believe as important - - that no language had been found to retain less than 86 % of some sample wordlist ( swadesh 's 100 ? does n't matter as you shall soon see ) per thousand years . the claim is false , but never mind , i ' ll grant it as true . i ' ll even grant you 90 % retention . america , they say , was populated 18 , 000 years ago . well , not so , evidence from brazil now seem to push it back to 50 , 000 bp . but i ' ll grant you 18 , 000 bp . and that everybody since the great crossing was careful not to be linguistically overly innovative , so that there exist at least two maximally distant languages which have retained 90 % of their vocabulary millennium in millenium out . today you could expect to see between them 0 . 9 ^ ( 18 * 2 ) = 0 . 0225 , i . e . 2 . 25 % words in common . on that famous 100 - item highly stable "" basic "" vocabulary . so that 's your proto - amerind reconstituted . now , of course , we have not taken chance resemblances into account . if you remember greenberg sci . am . article and his calculations , he estimates the probability of chance resemblances at 1 in 250 . but he forgets that he allows a bit of metathesis . in fact , if you read carefully ruhlen 's "" on the origin of languages "" complete anagramming , since he list irish "" bligim "" as cognate with his * malk ' a . there are six ways in which you can combine 3 consonants , so that is really one chance of resemblance in 42 ( 250 / 6 = a tad under 42 ) . using their figure , then , how many chance resemblances show you expect to find in a 100 - item wordlist ? 100 / 42 = 2 . 38 . bingo ! more than real cognates after 18 , 000 years with very conservative languages . now , * if * america was really populated 50 , 000 years ago we should see 0 . 9 ^ ( 50 * 2 ) = 0 . 002656 % of your 100 - item list preserved . that 's one word in 37 , 649 . so out of every pair of 100 - item lists you will find , on the average , 1 / 37649 * 100 = 0 . 0027 wrods in common . meaning that you can look forward to examining some 376 pairs before you find one single cognate . but thanks to mass comparison , you are sure to find it . only compare 50 seemingly * unrelated * languages ( because you want to pick maximally distant languages ) . that gives you 50 * ( 50 - 1 ) / 2 = 1225 pairwise comparisons . with a bit of luck , that will give 3 or 4 cognates , each attested by 2 or 3 languages . . . . and stacks of spurious resemblances , each attested by far many more languages than your true cognates . perhaps america was not populated 50 , 000 years ago . but australia was at least 40 , 000 bp . that does not prevent some from reconstructing proto - australian . and trying to link it to indo - european . enough fun with figures . why do n't you try to * simulate * a paltry 30 , 000 years worth of evolution of 30 languages each represented by 100 words , with a one-in - 250 ( see how generous i am ) chance of resemblances ?

0,"sum : object affixes dear linguists the time has come for me to post a summary based on replies to a query i posted a few weeks ago . this summary is rather long , and has the following structure : 1 ) the original query 2 ) acknowledgement of respondents 3 ) discussion of a few languages 4 ) general discussion 5 ) refs 6 ) outline of relevant details of roviana 7 ) summary 1 ) the query ) i am studying roviana , a western oceanic lg . there are pronominal object ) suffixes which occur on the verb indexing person , number etc . however , ) there are no affixes on the verb which would correspond to 's ubject ' ) ( however we might construe the concept ) . dixon ( 1994 ) claims that there ) are no lgs with object affixes but which lack subject affixes . does ) anybody else know of any other counter-examples ? 2 ) acknowledgements . my thanks to the following people ( listed in no particular order ) for their responses ( and my apologies if i have left anyone out ) : matthew dryer , karen wallace , mark campana , eloise jelinek , leo connolly , geoffrey nathan , johannes heinecke , malcolm ross , mark mandel , jaejung song . first , a point of clarification . by western oceanic i mean a branch of eastern austronesian . some of the replies seemed to indicate that people interpreted it to mean western austronesian . ( not that it is really important ) . some people replied with examples of languages with object affixes , whether or not the languages in question also had affixes indicating other grammatical relations . matthew dryer replied with the following list of languages which have object affixes but no subject affixes ( taken from an a database mentioned by him in language 1992 ) : africa : central khoisan ( nama ) , ijoid ( kolokuma ijo ) , gur ( bimoba ) , east chadic ( kera ) , biu-mandara ( margi , mbara ) , west chadic ( ngizim ) . eurasia : nax ( ingush ) , avaro-andi - dido ( avar ) , lezgic ( archi ) , munda ( mundari ) . se asia oceania : nicobarese ( car nicobarese ) , central-eastern malayo-polynesian ( kiribatese , ponapean , woleaian ) . north america : pimic ( papago ) . south america : warao , maipurean ( palikur ) . i have not been able to follow up on all of these refs . i have however , looked at the micronesian languages . 3 ) discussion of a few languages sohn ( 1975 ) re woleaian : object suffixes , but no affixes corresponding to any other grammatical relation . 3sg has three forms : zero and - y / - w . it seems that verbs fall in to two classes , with zero being added to verbs in one class ( many of whose members appear to have a tr suffix ) and - y / - w to members of the other class ( the choice in forms being phonologically conditioned ) . interestingly , 3pl distinguishes animate vs inanimate , whereas all other persons and numbers do not . these affixes can occur with or without an overt independent object np . these affixes occur on certain post-verbal advbs , suggesting that they might in fact be clitics . zewen ( 1977 ) re marshallese . pronominal objects immediately follow the verb . 3sg and 3pl are enclitics and undergo vowel harmony . these enclitics can co-occur with lexical np object . ' subject ' prons are all independent . groves , groves and jacobs ( 1985 ) re kiribatese . it seems from their description that the language has object suffixes but no other affixes indicating grammatical relations . however , there are things which could perhaps be analyzed as subject prefixes ( p1 08 ) . exactly which object suffixes get attached ( out of 11 classes ) seems to be lexically determined . 4 ) general discussion it would appear that there are no cross-linguistic studies of object affixes per se . some respondents questioned whether the object suffixes in roviana are really suffixes and not just clitics . they are suffixes , but even if they were n't the focus of my interest would be the same . i am focussing on two facts about roviana : ( a ) the case marking on np 's is on an ergative-absolutive basis , but the only grammatical relation indicated by verbal affixes is object . ( b ) of the object affixes , only 3pl has zero form . being functionally inclined , i am interested in finding a motivation for ( b ) . it is not simply a case of referentiality ( see the brief sketch below ) . 5 ) refs ( with diacritics mangled by the internet ) corston , simon h . 1993 . ergativity in roviana . ma thesis : auckland university , new zealand . ( to appear in the pacific linguistics series ) . groves , terab ' ata r , groves , gordon w . and jacobs , roderick . 1985 . kiribatese : an outline description . pacific linguistics , series d , no . 64 . anu printing service : anu . sohn , ho - min with the assistance of tawerilmang , anthony f . 1975 . woleian reference grammar . pacific and asian languages institute : micronesia . honoloulu : university press of hawaii . zewen , francois - xavier n . 1977 . the marshallese language : a study of its phonology , morphology and syntax . veroffentlichungen des seminars fur indonesische und sudseesprachen der universitat hamburg , band 10 . berlin : verlag . 6 ) outline of relevant details of roviana the following is a brief description of roviana based on my own field work ( corston 1993 ) . case marking on np 's is split ergative , in a typologically unusual way : absolutive is marked ( si / se ) , ergative is unmarked . pronouns , proper np 's and enumerated np 's in main clauses distinguish erg vs abs by means of special particles . all other np 's are neutral ( ie do not formally distinguish a / s / o ) . as well as using special particles , prons distinguish erg vs abs in the form of the pron . a , s and o are always specific . person object suffix 1sg - u , - au 2sg - xo 3sg - a 1pl . incl - xita 1pl . excl - xami 2pl - xamu 3pl - 0 ( zero ) these affixes are similar to or the same as various indep pronouns , e . g . compare rau 1sg xoi 2sg xita 1pl . incl xami 1pl . excl xamu 2pl but , asa 3sg abs or sa 3sg erg sarini 3pl abs or ri 3pl erg ( there is quite a story to sarini historically , see the ma ) if there is a do np , you get the affixes e . g . meke doxor-i - a ri si keke ixana and see - tr-3sg . do they abs one fish ( erg ) ' and they saw a fish . ' ( animals , 034 ) ( the paper i am writing now clarifies why i only put erg in parentheses - it is really unmarked , and you have to infer in this context that the pron = erg because there is no particle ) kote arina tie mae magu-i - 0 sarini fut pl man come carve - tr-3pl . do 3pl . abs ' the men will come and carve them up . ' ( feast , 016 ) ( them = pigs in a feast ) nb , here the do is the pron sarini . however , you can get the affixes even if there is no overt do np , suggesting that they have independent reference , e . g . ai lul-i - u mo intj follow - tr-1sg . do dt ' hey ! follow me . ' ( animals , 011 ) and the following longer example . e saimone sa tie he-hegere hoirana . pers simon def man dup - laugh there ' that 's simon , the man who 's laughing over there . ' avos-i - a xoi ? hear - tr-3sg . do you ( erg ) ' do you hear him ? ' ( day , 029-030 ) note that the suffixes do not ' index ' absolutive etc , only o . ( see ma ) roviana has case marked and quantified np 's . case ( erg , abs , obl , etc ) is indicated by articles before the np . quantifiers ( numbers , 's ome ' , ' all ' etc ) precede the head n . non - specific undergoers obligatorily occur in a backgrounded object construction . compare the following two examples . raro talo si gami cook taro abs 1pl . excl ' we cooked taro ' / ' we did some taro cooking ' it is difficult to say if ' talo ' is ' incorporated ' since there are no other indep elements assoc with the verb which ever come after . note that the backgrounded constr is intr , with no transitive marking , and with the actor as s . compare to the ' usual ' order vao raro-a gami sa talo cook - 3sg . do 1pl . excl def taro ' we cooked the taro . ' undergoers which are pragmatically backgrounded can also occur in the backgrounded object construction , irrespective of whether they are referential or not . 7 ) summary * languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . * i feel that having 3pl as the only zero form is unusual , but am unable to find a cross-linguistic study to bear this out . even so , the zero form requires a functional explanation ( cf du bois , john w . 1987 ' absolutive zero : paradigm adaptivity in sacapultec maya ' , lingua 71 : 203-222 ) . again , my thanks to those who replied . ps i should have a draft of my paper ' featuredness and core arguments in roviana ' available shortly . simon corston corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu

0,"ipa i have been enjoying the discussion about how nice it would be to "" end the chaos of multiple standards "" and go to a single system recommended by the lsa - - either ipa or some cooperatively designed one . but i think it might be impossible to achieve concensus : there is not only the old "" americanist "" vs . ipa debate , but also at least two more - - one is the issue of whether to break away from or continue to use the systems that have developed over time and become standard for linguistic work in particular language families ; and the other is the disparity between linguistic writing and the official or practical writing systems accepted in language communities - - the latter often being linguistically adequate and sometimes preferred by linguists so that the speakers can have better access to the information being recorded and published by the linguist . i suppose these considerations need not keep us from attempting to come to a consensus that might encourage introductory texts in linguistics to use a particular system ; but students will still be forced to develop knowledge of multiple writing systems as soon as they start reading articles rather than textbooks . as for me , i have come to enjoy the diversity of writing systems almost as much as i enjoy the diversity of languages .

0,"n-ary comparison ( 1 ) very strongly support alexis mr 's message on n-ary comparison being stronger than binary comparison . as real minds work , it is the pragmatics of not going down false trails which is at issue . i am puzzled only by what he mentions as an exceptional case , that is , how ternary comparison could * * * ever * * * be worse than binary . even if a third language is included which is more divergent , has more loan vocabulary , or whatever , and therefore poses extra problems or barriers . that is not a consequence of the ternary status in the comparison , because if the same language were included as one member of a binary comparison , the same problems would presumably be there . ( 2 ) i did not respond earlier only because of lack of time . the preference for n-ary comparison , the claim that n-ary is only a multiple of binary , is obviously false , just as the notion that one should not be engaging in comparison if one needs to use a dictionary is obviously false ( alice faber answered that one , that if that restriction had been enforced , our knowledge would be far less than it now securely is ) . both of these supposed restrictions are for the convenience of the linguist analyst , artificially restricting the data available so as to make it seem as if the analyst 's knowledge is more complete for the task than it is , and give a greater ( but artificial ) sense of psychological security . it goes along with the statement by some historical linguists that they "" never want to make a mistake "" . of course none of us do , but some are willing to in order to advance knowledge , and even those who do not want to cannot make themselves immune . the very act of disregarding data which is "" too far afield "" can sometimes lead to mistakes . always possible when trying to * discover * answers when we do not know the answers in advance . rather , we are all human , and gigantic problems will be beyond any of us to completely solve ( attempts at partial solutions do not imply guilt or wrongdoing ) . this in no way implies we should not attempt to solve those problems . we should be tolerant of others ' efforts and use the best part of them , always . ( 3 ) j "" org knappen 's suggestion of "" families , classes , and orders "" a la the biologists does seem useful . can we have suggestions as to clues when we should use one or the other of such terms ? presumably some more sophisticated measure of degree of shared genetic material would be most analogous to the biological usages , rather than a simple lexicostatistical measure ? lloyd anderson

0,"re : sapir - whorf and what to tell students these days here 's what i tell my undergrad and grad students about that same chapter in language files . i . e . , it 's difficult to even judge what 's going on with whorf unless you are simultaneously conversant with linguistics , american indian languages , and at least the insights of modern physics . first , the conclusion that is appropriate is that , as i showed in "" the demise of the whorf hypothesis "" ( berkeley linguistics society , 1978 ? ) , what whorf said has little or generally no relation whatever to the entire body of discussion that comes under the name "" ( sapir - ) whorf hypothesis "" . he showed decades before the critics came up with their own hypotheses , which they failed to name after themselves , that he would never have agreed with their characterization of his thoughts . simple test : read the lf chapter and then ask , "" who created the whorf hypothesis ? "" and a quick way to answer this is : what did whorf himself call it in his two or three references ? he called it the "" principle of linguistic relativity "" or the "" linguistic relativity principle "" . my own reading of whorf never finds the word "" hypothesis "" at all . so - - right off the bat , and this is a good way to teach scientific nomenclature , who turned whorf 's ' principle ' into a ( n ) ' hypothesis ' , and why ? it was n't whorf , because his designation was clear . so what is the difference between the two ? well , a principle is like an axiom in geometry : a starting point which is theoretically unverifiable - - it 's just a starting point . you want something else , you begin from a different starting point , and then you develop your hypotheses from there . next : what does whorf 's "" linguistic relativity principle "" have to do , if anything , with einstein 's "" relativity principle "" ( which i covered in my also bls , 1980 ? , paper , "" is whorf 's relativity einstein 's relativity ? "" ) . ah , now we ' ve gotten to the crux of it - - much against pinker 's stand ( which was copied and intensified in a lingua franca short bio of suzette elgin hayden recently , where a digression found its author saying that whorf cobbled together his theory from a few ill-translated snatches of apache - - echoing a pinker statement and relying on pinker 's quoting whorf correctly , which he did n't , about a canoe on a beach pointwise : which pinker identified as an apache sentence , but which whorf knew quite well was nootka in the pacific northwest rather than apache in the beachless desert ) , whorf was upping the ante on einstein , who argued that euclidian geometry , far from being universal , was applicable only to flat surfaces ; that for round surfaces , which most of reality is made up of , you need non - euclidian geometry . i . e . , when the phenomena change significantly , you have to change the tool you ' re using . well , that 's what whorf said too ( see heisenberg 's lament below ) , except he moved its domain from mathematics to natural human language ; hence : the truly aptly named "" principle of linguistic relativity "" as whorf himself named it . admittedly , this does n't make any sense until you see it in action , in "" an american indian model of the universe , "" where he posits a worldview without our tense / time ( past / present / future diorama or river of time ) , using manifested / manifesting ( plus other synonyms ) instead . that is : sae grammars / cultures give that aforementioned notion of "" time "" , which is supported and maintained by their tense systems ( though , admittedly , english is weird and gets it through the culture side of the language / culture system ) ; the hopi language / culture system has no such image of time , working from a different worldview principle that sees only cyclical , not linear , time - - round , not flat . most of the world 's grammars that have broken out of the latinate mold show that the particular time / tense system of sae is pretty much peculiar to western european languages - - hence a linguistic / cultural ontology of "" time "" as we know and practice it , and not the supposed universal we have so fondly believed it to be . side note : for one who reads whorf closely , he makes five or ten times more universalist statements than relativity statements in his writings , yet he is seen ( and reviled in a chomskyan universalist attitude ) as the relativist par excellent . so right from the get-go we see that 1 ) whorf did n't write and would n't agree with the hypothesis that someone ( s ) named after him ; 2 ) rather than being some deranged crackpot , he was merely literate : whorf was one of the few interdisciplinary thinkers between physics and linguistics in this century ; 3 ) whorf 's relativity principle had something important to do with einstein 's ; and 4 ) whorf was a universalist as well as a relativist - - he just had them in balance , a notable enough rarity in current academe , you must admit . if i may be so bold , alluding to your posting that "" no one has disproved whorf 's mild version of linguistic relativity ( let 's leave ling . determinism aside , or the stronger version . ) "" , even the mild version was n't his ! trace back like i did and you will find that whorf espoused neither strong nor weak versions of determinism , and relativity has nothing to do with determinism when you see it from the physics viewpoint above , as he did . if you read carefully , writers about the whorf hypothesis admit that even whorf did n't hold a strong version of determinism ( so if he did n't , who did ? and if nobody did , why bring it up ? ) , and that all the critics hold the weak version that they dreamed up ( even though whorf would n't hold it because it 's at least weakly deterministic and therefore newtonian ) . so what 's going on ? the problem is that whorf had already , from his acquaintance with physics , moved from newtonian monocausal determinism as an ideal into systems thinking - - where sometimes the opposite of one profound truth is another profound truth , where everything is interdependent , multicausal , interconnected : language shapes culture while culture is shaping language ; language shapes thinking while thinking is shaping language . the cumulative effect of the ( humboldt / boas / sapir - ) whorf hypothesis literature has been primarily to throw up a smokescreen around his ideas so that people , including grad students in linguistics , psychology , anthropology and sociology , won't read him in the original ( english ! ) . i tell my grad students that if they want to really find out what their discipline is about , go find out who their discipline is beating up on and read them ; and if you are so lucky as me to find someone that four major academic disciplines are ganging up on - - you know you ' ve hit a goldmine ! what in the world could be so important that four academic disciplines create a combined smokescreen ? because so few linguists in this century have availed themselves of the changes in thinking about reality that physics has been broadcasting during this entire century , few linguists are even qualified to step into what they did n't realize was an interdisciplinary debate in the history of ideas which whorf felt so comfortable in . i ' ll explain . i ' ll give you a synopsis of a talk i intend to give at a 100th birthday conference for benjamin whorf , which i intend to get funding for and hold in the bay area in spring 1997 . i call it "" heisenberg 's lament . "" you see , early in this century , that ' uncertain ' heisenberg was among the first to gain a ' glimpse ' into the subatomic world ; and , having done so , he rendered his opinion that , regarding the subatomic realm , "" we have reached the limits of our language . "" he said this for two reasons : 1 ) no matter how glibly western scientists talk about electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks , etc . , when we look into that realm there are no ' things ' , only processes and relationships ; but in order to make sense ( i . e . , complete sentences ) in sae languages , we need nouns - - and there 's nothing in the subatomic realm that you can , except willy-nilly , attach nouns to . and 2 ) given that , our most fundamental scientific terms such as "" same "" and "" different "" are useless . he did n't know then , and physics does n't know now , whether there are gazillions of electrons or just one electron with gazillions of manifestations . we have reached the limits of our language . fast - forward a few decades and whorf hears this in his physics classes at yale ( he has unpublished manuscripts on gravity in the yale archives ) , and ponders : hm , i wonder if this has anything to do with what prof . sapir said the other day about hopi not needing nouns to express ordinary propositions - - just "" rehpi "" , "" flashed "" , instead of "" it "" or "" the / a light flashed "" : because when you come right down to it , how is the flashing different from the light ? is "" light "" just a convenient grammatical fiction foisted upon us by sae grammar ? and as he pondered ' light ' being noun or verb , particle or wave , depending on how it 's viewed , he saw the universe in the same way , with different cultures taking different positions on the question . in this case , since hopi did n't seem to take too seriously the absence of nouns , perhaps , whorf surmised , hopi could be of use for physicists in exploring and reporting back about the quantum world , that realm that did n't have thingy nouns . fast - forward another few decades and physicist david bohm reads whorf ( which i confirmed personally in talking to him ) , and then , * in response * ( my attribution ) , writes _ wholeness and the implicate order _ , in which he , among other things , tries to make english more verby and performative in the "" rheomode "" - - a brilliant flop ; and then launches on the scientific community a view of the universe which does not contain our familiar notions of past / present / future time , but instead an implicate and explicate order of reality - - an "" inny / outty "" notion where the future is inside us working outward instead of some vague distant goal we are headed toward . an email acquaintance pointedly asked me what the difference was between bohm 's terminology and whorf 's terminology ; it took me 6 months to finally answer that there was none , except the hopis had had theirs for millennia longer . and then it hit me ! bohm , in his own maverick way , appropriated whorf 's answer to heisenberg 's lament in "" an american indian model of the universe "" and substituted more scientifically acceptable terminology ( implicate / explicate rather than manifesting / manifested ) to see how the notion of a universe without linear time would fly in the modern physics and academic community - - and it had qualified success . but - - bohm was no closer to knowing whether whorf had been accurate in his description of hopi than he had been before writing the book . and there had been so much bad press on the guy ! how was one to know , ultimately ? and here 's the part that almost no-one knows so far . in 1991 , in the last few months of his life , david bohm launched his most ambitious thought experiment to date : with some other physicists and a few psychologists and linguists , and sponsored by the fetzer institute , he enticed recognized american indian intellectual leaders ( and some of their elders ) to join in dialogue together in what i can only describe as a roundabout way of asking american indians whether whorf was accurate in his description of the ' timeless ' hopi worldview . but it became so much more ! the american indian leaders there had previously read bohm 's book and others , but the physicists knew nothing about native american worldviews and native american science methodologies , so the indians had to build a bridge over to them in private meetings before the three public days on the themes of time , space and language . during the day on time , whorf 's description of hopi came up , was read out loud , and discussed , though i do n't remember any hopis being present ; nevertheless , the other american indians present , mostly of algonquian tribes , gave what can only be called ' independent verification ' in scientific terminology by saying essentially : well , i can't speak for the hopi people , but that 's pretty much the way we do it . in fact , of the many whorf passages read or discussed in these dialogues , the physicists and the american indians present were usually willing to give whorf his points ( proving again , perhaps , the difficulty of being a prophet in one 's own country / discipline ! ) . but we ' re not done yet - - the best is yet to come - - the actual conclusion of heisenberg 's lament ! at the beginning of the first dialogue it was clear that the quantum physicists had their favorite realm to explore and talk about , and the american indians also had their own favorite realm . as we dialogued , it began becoming clear that those favorite realms had some fundamental principles in common : the only constant is flux ; everything that exists vibrates ; everything is interconnected such that the part implicates the whole . in fact , it became crystal clear that the last major obstacle to these realms being the same realm was really only terminological : the physicists are used to calling it "" the subatomic realm "" whereas the american indians for millennia have been calling it "" the spirit realm "" . now that 's a big enough surprise - - that modern physics is knocking on the door of spirit without really meaning to - - but not big enough , so now let 's take it home ! it puzzled the physicists just how the american indians should have foreknowledge of a realm they should n't know about , that the western scientific infrastructure had just recently led us to - - and the indians had no such scientific infrastructure ! and as the physicists gradually understood that , like hopi , the algonquian grammatical structures do not demand nouns , do not demand fictitious actors to embody actions ( that , as my mikmaq and blackfoot friends tell me , they can talk all day long in those languages and never utter a single ' noun ' ! ) , they finally had to admit that such languages were indeed much better suited to exploring that realm and reporting back than sae languages - - whorf 's reply to heisenberg 's lament was verified and agreed upon . when the phenomena of reality change in a dramatic way , you need to change the tool you ' re using . now , of course , the physicists were left with an even larger puzzle , to wit : how is it that these american indians have a language much better suited than sae languages to investigate and describe the inner workings of the subatomic realm - - a realm they are n't even supposed to know about ! ? ! as you can see by now , pinker - - like all other facile critics and unindicted co-creators of the so-called hypothesis - - is out of his league altogether in attempting to characterize a major player in one of the most important interdisciplinary discussions ever in the history of ideas . pinker , like chomsky , loves logic ( which grows out of the grammar of sae languages just as the philosophy of ' karma ' grew out of the grammar of ancient sanskrit , where it was used earliest as the linguistics term for 'd irect object ' ! ! ) , but has never really gotten with the program this century to replace binary / dualistic thinking with multivariable / multicausal / interdependent systems thinking . whorf heard the call , way back then , and may yet prove to have been an entire century ahead of his time in linguistics . even though we can think in systems for phonology and grammar , we have a tough time doing it for "" language and thought "" ; we feel we have to make them bipolar opposites such that they are distinct and one causes the other invariantly ; that 's why i so admired how slobin finally lost those monolithic terms and framed the question instead in terms of "" thinking for speaking "" - - the at least one kind of thinking where your thinking is very much at the mercy of the forms and categories of your language , per whorf . so tell your students , as i do , that the only way to get to the bottom of what whorf did or did not say is to read his essays in _ language , thought & reality _ for themselves , perhaps with the above thoughts as a guideline , and then figure out for themselves whether the sapir - whorf hypothesis smokescreen makes any sense .

0,"sum : ' because ' versus 's ince / as ' ( 6 . 1043 ) i would like to thank the following persons very much for their judgements , comments and various hints concerning my query : marie egan , duncan macgregor , richard ingham , james kirchner , kevin lemoine , david powers , karen ward , yael ziv and especially karen stanley , who took a poll about my claims among her colleagues ( a big thank-you to them too ) . > from the mail i have received by now , the following picture emerges : including the people interviewed by k . stanley , 7 do not agree with my distinction and 5 do agree more or less . some informants suggest other distinctions between the conjunctions : for one , 's ince ' and ' as ' are more formal than ' because ' ( a view which is also presented in some dictionaries and grammars ) , for another , ' as ' is more formal than ' because ' but 's ince ' is "" only suitable for informal conversation but nor for writing "" . the latter judgement seems to be in conformity with a prescriptivist view according to which 's ince ' as a causal conjunction is not to be used at all . ( i want to note that i have identified 209 ( = 13 % ) causal since-clauses among 1576 causal as - , because - , for - and since-clauses in the machine readable british - english lob - corpus ( written texts from 1961 ) . most of these since-clauses are to be found in the category called ' learned and scientific writing ' . ) another informant , for whom my example sentence ( 1 ) is essentially synonymous with either conjunction , has the impression that the speaker of ( 1 ) using ' because ' "" feels john 's admission more noteworthy , or more important to the narrative , than he or she would if 's ince ' or ' as ' were used . "" into the same direction , i assume , goes another judgement according to which ' because ' is "" stronger and more explicit and more exceptional . "" ( i have found a similar view in the literature and have interpreted it as a consequence of my differentiation : entailment on the basis of a rule or norm is intrinsically less noteworthy , less exceptional than ' real ' causation . ) some people have pointed out the relevance of the position of the causal clause . as a tendency , my rule / norm interpretation is considered to be more in accordance with the causal clause ( be it 's ince / as ' or ' because ' ) preceding its main / matrix clause . however , one informant feels "" more comfortable with since clauses preceding , and because clauses following , the main clause . "" ( this impression is somehow in conformity with the statistical situation in the above mentioned lob - corpus : only about 9 % of the because-clauses are preposed , whereas 41 % of the since-clauses and 43 % of the as-clauses are preposed there . ) one informant pointed out constraints which may affect the acceptability of 's ince ' as a causal conjunction : "" 's ince ' seems to have a much more limited application . for me there is a tense / aspect / ? ? ? constraint between the clauses ( consistent with the temporal meaning it also has ? ? ) , otherwise it sounds forced or stilted . i do n't really like your sentence ( 1 ) with 's ince ' . reversing the clauses makes it more acceptable to me , as does changing ' was ' to ' is ' ( strange ! ) . conversely , changing ' has been ' to ' was ' makes the 's ince ' version even less acceptable to me . "" ( probably , the last point in this quotation is caused by the fact that replacement of ' was ' by ' has been ' makes the sentence grammatically acceptable with a temporal interpretation of the since-clause . ) do i have to conclude from the ' empirical ' outcome of my query that my differentiation is not tenable ? for various reasons ( which i hope to develop convincingly in a doctoral dissertation to be submitted soon ) , i do not think so . are there , perhaps , some more people ' out there ' who agree with my claims , but who refrain from simply stating ' i agree ' ? of course , this would not make my query statistically more valid , but it would suggest that there is some plausibility to my non-empirical reasons . carsten breul e-mail : carsten . breul @ rz . ruhr-uni - bochum . de

0,"sex bias and epicenes h . stephen straight is right to mention the importance of the essentially psychological evidence in favor of the idea that epicene he biases perceptions in favor male interpretations . there are considerable number of studies of this effect and a few attempts at interpretation as to how it comes about . essentially , the studies take two tacks . one model involves an interpretation task of some kind in which subjects are induced to provide some form of evidence of male or female interpretation of the referent of some generic epicene . the independent variable was the pronoun coreferent to epicene antecedents in invented sentences presented to subjects . subjects give names to characters , draw pictures , or say directly whether a character is male or female , etc . this type began back in 1970 , with an almost impossible to locate study by kidd . the most famous version was probably martyna 's ( 1978 , 1980 ) work and the latest version i am aware of was an experiment by gastil in 1990 . also , there were experiments by kosrohshahi in 1989 , moulton , robins , & elias in 1978 , and switzer in 1990 . the other type involves production tasks in which subjects selected a coreferential pronoun to complete sentences with antecedents refering generic epicene referents . here the independent variable was the degree of sex-stereotypicality of the generic referent ( e . g . marine vs . teenager vs . nurse ) . this type of study was inaugurated by martyna ( 1978 , 1980 ) . it was also used by gastil . in almost all studies uses of he strongly correlat with male interpretations of the referent . my own naturalistic data shows the same result with referents like ' lumberjack ' and ' particpants in congressional sex scandal ' used more with he than say ' child , ' or ' teacher . ' there are others along both lines , which will be supplied upon request . as for explanations , the most interesting ones for someone ( like me ) who tends to be skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on other aspects of cognition ( please let 's not start that one again ) are by mcconnell - ginet in a number of articles ( e . g . 1988 ) and moulton back in 1977 . moulton eschews notions of markedness and instead compares it to the kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinate category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical . so kleenex are most prototypical paper tissues , sanka is the prototypical decaf coffee ( in the us ) , and so on . note that this involves cognitive interaction with lexical semantics ; there is nothing morphosyntactic going on here . refs : ( i ' ll put full names whenever i remember ; i do n't want to look up all the arts . ) gastil , john ( 1990 ) "" generic pronouns and sexist language sex roles , 23 629-643 kidd , v .

0,"genetic classification i wish to make some comments on an issue that recent discussion of nostratic and the problem of "" demonstrating "" distant genetic relationships has skirted around that i believe underlies some of the issues that various people have been directly addressing . an assumption that seems to underly much of the discussion is that hypotheses regarding genetic relationships are not interesting unless they can be proven to be true . i find this a rather odd assumption , and one that does not seem to be made about any other kinds of hypotheses in linguistics ( or anywhere else in science as far as i know ) . and let us set aside for the sake of argument the oft-noted point that the notion of proof is not really applicable to empirical hypotheses , and assume that the term is to be used loosely for some arbitrary high level of certainty . it seems fair to say that there is a fairly widespread disinterest in hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis because it is widely believed ( and i will assume it is true here for the sake of argument ) that the available evidence for nostratic falls short of this imaginary level of certainty which deserves the label "" proven "" . a common type of reaction to unproven hypotheses is that it has not been demonstrated that the observed similarities might not be due to chance and / or borrowing . but suppose that someone were to take the same attitude towards comparative reconstruction of protolanguages . suppose that someone were to object to comparative reconstruction of anything but very shallow groups on the grounds that one can never prove that the reconstructions are correct . just as one can object to certain claims of genetic relationships on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate the possibility that the observed similarities might be due to accident and / or borrowing , one could equally well object to virtually all hypotheses surrounding comparative reconstruction on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate alternative possibilities . the comparative method is a way to come up with the best guess one can make about a protolanguage ; it never provides proof that the reconstruction is in fact correct . so why bother doing it ? the answer should be obvious : hypotheses which represent our best guesses at any point in time are what much of science is about . by why do so many linguists seem to object to applying the same way of thinking to hypotheses about genetic relationships ? why is it that many historical linguists find the hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis either laughable or upsetting ? why do n't they react the same way to comparative reconstructions , since they also are "" unproven "" ? why do n't they rush out and read everything they can find on nostratic and conclude "" the evidence is tantalizing but not conclusive ; it 's a really exciting hypothesis "" ? why is there such a double standard ? i want to suggest an answer to this question , an answer which , if right , provides insight into the nature of many debates surrounding controversial hypotheses of genetic relationship . namely , some people find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , quite apart from any detailed historical work that plays a role in supporting hypotheses . other people , however , are primarily interested in the detailed historical work itself , and do not find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , but only interesting in so far as they are an inevitable consequence of historical work . people of the first sort are more likely to find recent work reclassifying penutian languages exciting , while people of the latter sort are unlikely to react that way , unless they are penutian specialists . as one moves back in time , the ability to apply the comparative method becomes increasingly difficult , and detailed historical work becomes increasingly speculative ( and to many historical linguists , dissatisfying ) . but at any time depth , we can always be much more confident of the genetic classification than we can of any comparative reconstructions . our confidence in indo - european as a language family is surely greater than our confidence in any specific claims about proto - indo - european . but as we move further back in time , we should expect there to be hypotheses that we cannot be entirely confident of , but for which there is at least some promising evidence , where any comparative reconstruction is going to be sufficiently speculative as to not be satisfying to linguists interested in traditional comparative work . and since these linguists are not interested in genetic classification except as a biproduct of detailed historical work , such linguists are likely to find the hypotheses uninteresting . on the other hand , for linguists who find questions of genetic classification inherently interesting , the fact that detailed historical work may not be possible is irrelevant , and the fact that the hypothesis is unproven or unprovable may be no more a source of concern than the fact comparative reconstructions are always unproven and unprovable . if this view is correct , much of the debate surrounding controversial hypotheses in genetic classification is based , not on substantive questions , but simply on what sorts of questions different people find interesting . matthew dryer

1,"how 's it going ? hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il

1,"profit on technology ! ( pardon this intrusion , you were mentioned as someone who would have an interest in technology ) we are in the beginning of an exciting , "" trillion dollar emerging market "" in technology . in the next 3 minutes below , i will show you how to capitalize on this extraordinary trend ! here 's the trillion dollar trend in american business that i ' m speaking of ! you may have noticed over the past few months the incredible number of billion dollar mergers in us business . huge mergers like worldcom and mci , travelers and citicorp - the list is endless but they one common thread - services , services , services ! ! services like : travel services , banking services , telephony services , entertainment services and utility services . all of these services that you , i and everyone we know use , are being combined into one , trillion dollar market of "" bundled services "" . services have been the fastest growing segment of the us economy for a number of years but this "" bundled services "" market is new . these are services that everyone uses - everyday , offered from one , simple source ! why are "" bundled services "" such a big deal ? let 's add it up : banking services = hundreds of billions travel services = hundred of billions telephony services = $ 200 billion in us , $ 1 trillion worldwide ( internet access , paging , cellular , long distance , local dial , cable tv , digital satellite , voice mail , virtual office , web tv ) utilities ( being deregulated now ) : electricity = $ 250 billion , gas = $ 70 bill . internet commerce = $ 8 billion ( projected to reach $ 350 billion in 5 years ) in short , "" bundled services "" are every conceivable service that you , i and everyone we know uses . a war is waging for these huge markets with the largest service companies in the world , and millions will be made from those entrepreneurs who position themselves in front of this trend . these service / technology companies are buying companies left and right so they can offer more services . these companies are fighting tooth and nail because they know something most of us do n't know . as a gte study reveals , when a customer enrolls on a single service they will stay on that service for an average of 2 years , with two services the average moves to 4 years . when a customer enrolls on 3 services , they will stay with that provider for an incredible average of 20 years ! imagine the cash flow on just one customer using 3 - 6-10 - 20 services , for 20 years . what would that cash flow be worth ? a whole bunch , and that 's why the race is on . the first company to get customers on 3 or more services - wins ! that 's why these service companies are spending billions in advertising to attract customers . but . . . these huge , traditional service companies have a serious problem . they can not get directly in front these customers . even if they could send someone directly over , would they find them at home ? if they were at home , would they let them in their house ? people decide on which service companies they wish to use , based on recommendations from people they know ! here 's my point : who better to make recommendations for services than from the people you know ! we do this unconsciously everyday anyway - now you can get paid for it ! we simply , and very passively , offer people we know , a "" free package of services "" designed to save them money and make their life simpler . the more they use the more they save ! this package will make their life easier with single billing for all the services they use . we can save them money by leveraging our parent companies $ 1 . 6 billion dollar buying power to offer the most competitive prices available anywhere for this package ! it gets even better ! we are not talking about no-name companies with questionable service . we are talking about the biggest service and technology companies in the world ! companies that are already a household name . these companies realize that "" word of mouth "" is the best way to get in front of customers . your associates & friends win , and you win ! they handle all the service / customer support - we just make the recommendation ( this could be as simple as passing out a brochure ) . services can create a true residual income ( no inventories here ! ) . what could an extra $ 10 - $ 50 , 000 a year do for your family - for the next 20 years ? with a more concentrated effort , the potential is "" income replacement "" and beyond . in addition to the monthly residual income you will earn on these services , you may also earn over rides on other re-marketers . the system of delivering services in the next evolutionary step in networking - we call it "" internetworking "" . the reason we call it "" internetworking "" is that everything can be accomplished via the internet . given the trillion dollar size of this untapped market , our financial backing and billion dollar partners , we project that we will be a billion dollar company and household name in 3 years . you are learning about us in the first 30 days ! timing is everything . imagine if you talked with an associate who has numerous property management contacts . let 's say this contact of yours knew several property managers who own thousands of rental units . the property management company could offer these services to thousands of tenants . the property management company earns a fortune , your associate earns a fortune and you earn a fortune . this is leveraged income ! there are hundreds of ways to market this because everyone uses these services . as a matter of fact , who do you know that would not be interested in saving money on their service bills , with the same top grade service companies and have the convenience of a single bill ? in summary , bundled services are a trillion dollar untapped market , ripe for entrepreneurs with vision . customers get the same quality service from the largest providers but now through one source ! because of our buying power and the fact you afford to give bigger discounts when customers are using more services ( bundled ) , it 's a win / win situation , and represents one of the largest business trends of this century . . . food for thought . . . social psychologists tell us that each person runs into at least two opportunities that could in fact , reshape their lives . the question here is this , is this your first opportunity or your last ? an interesting question . with a simple investigation , you will determine this opportunity and company , is for real . if you ' re too busy , that 's exactly why you need to do this . in three years or less , you can create the lifestyle you wish , with the effort of course . get the facts and make an informed decision . please visit our site now : http : / / www . vwcs . com / pauld thank you for your attention , the wave 4 group ps : this is a one time mailing

0,"summary : vowels and sound symbolism summary : vowels and sound symbolism two weeks ago i circulated a message on the list asking for information on languages with sound-symbolic vowel hierarchies . what prompted this message was a description i came across of the longzhou dialect of the zhuang language spoken in guangxi province in southwestern china * . the language had a vowel hierarchy in following order i < e < a < o < u / w ( unrounded "" u "" ) which is manifest in the verbs , adjectives and measures of the language : the higher up on the hierarchy the vowel , the greater the magnitude or the intensity of the word . for example , ( 1 ) measures 1 . ni : p7 tsi3 ( a small stack of paper ) ne : p7 tsi3 ( a big stack of paper ) 2 . je : m1 kw1 ( a tiny pinch of salt ) ja : m1 kw1 ( a big handful of salt ) 3 . ki : n5 mai4 ( a tiny branch ) kw : n5 mai4 ( a big branch ) ( 2 ) verbs 1 . di : u1 ( to pry using a small tool ) da : u1 ( to pry using a large tool ) 2 . je : t7 ( a small object bouncing ) ja : t7 ( a large object bouncing ) 3 . ve : t7 ( to dig using a small tool ) va : t7 ( to dig using a large tool ) ( 3 ) adjectives 1 . ? e : u3 ( to bend or break ) ? e : u3 bje : p8 bje : p8 ( to break silently ) ? e : u3 bja : p8 bja : p8 ( to break , but slightly louder than the first ) ? e : u3 bjo : p8 bjo : p8 ( to break loudly ) ? e : u3 bju : p8 bju : p8 ( to break very loudly ) 2 . lai1 ( to flow ) lai1 se2 se2 ( to flow softly ) lai1 sa2 sa2 ( to flow , but slightly louder than the first ) lai1 so2 so2 ( to flow loudly ) lai1 su2 su2 ( to flow very loudly ) 3 . hau3 ( the weather being warm ) hau3 je : m5 ( the weather being slightly warm ) hau3 jo : m5 ( the weather being very warm ) hau3 ju : m5 ( the weather being extremely warm ) i asked if there were other languages that had similar mechanisms , and here are the replies . my thanks to jan lindstrom , stephen p . spackman , hiroshi hanara , bruce a . connell , anne gilman , dirk elzinga , and mark huber . * xie , zhiming . 1983 .

"" in proverbial use , with sometimes-plural verbs , has the weight of proverbial "" they who "" , and is related morpholgically to the feminine , not the masculine . a radical idea i wish someone would challenge me on . also , "" him "" and "" his "" were not only masculine , they were also neuter - - "" neither one or the other "" . to understand the modern paradigm , we have to study the history it grew out of , including the protogermanic and ie paradigms . i wonder if h . stephen straight has read my comments and quotations on "" the mark "" in recent discussion . all of us , men and women alike , can be described in some capacities as "" generic people "" . is n't this what we mean by "" society "" ? one veiw of the half-glass sees that we , as generic people , desire to give females preferential treatment , and have distinct words for those of us who are female ( she , women ) , but parallel words for males are , lacking , are tautonyms . we , those of us who are male , are relegated to use a word also used for everybody else . "" masculine "" is only sex-distinct in contrastive position with the "" feminine "" . the reason for generic pronouns doubling with the masculine is because men are , in our "" psychology "" thought of more frequently as generic people . females have long been accorded special priviledges in western society - - we do n't execute murderesses , we create conditions for those of us who are women to live 10 % longer than men , we exclude them from the military draft , old women commit suicide at a rate less than 1 / 12th that of old men , etc . that is not to say that everybody does n't have it rough once in a while . men do not externalize their victimization to a metaphorical "" daddy "" . i personally think that women should go on being afforded special status and privileges in language and society . the turning wine to venom these passed decades has shown the dark side of our society . the writer says < < < "" every one of the members of the boys and girls club loves his parents .

0,"ipa , austerlitz i learned phonetics and phonetic field technique from robert austerlitz ( 1923-1994 ) . after reading joseph stemberger 's comments on ipa and democratizing the process of standarizing phonetic writing ( in linguist 6 . 185 ) , i thought about how austerlitz taught . austerlitz never asked us to memorize ipa or any other system . instead , he taught us several different systems of notation all at once . he expected us to be able to describe sounds by place of articulation , manner of articulation , and so on . we were expected to + know + ipa , of course , and he referred us to several different sources , each of which had a slightly different version of it . but there were no standard systems in his classroom . he was a remarkable teacher and made me a fieldworker . he used a number of symbols that are rarely seen anywhere else . one of his favorites was the cardinal vowel "" 61 "" , by which ( if i remember correctly ) he meant the high back unrounded vowel written "" turned m "" in ipa . this "" 61 "" was merely the letter "" uy "" from the cyrillic alphabet . in his field-technique classes , we were encouraged to make up new symbols to describe what we heard . i remember , during a session with a speaker from shanqhae , he expressed the greatest pleasure when joseph davis wrote the initial consonant of ' cooked rice ' with a digraph made up of a "" v "" with a lowercase "" f "" planted between its arms . this expressed graphically the unusual shanqhae sound that davis had described - it was clearly a labiodental fricative , but somehow sounded both voiced and voiceless at the same time . austerlitz first mentioned that "" they "" in the ipa would say that diacritics could be used to express this , then recounted chao 's claim that many chinese dialects have initial consonants that are in-between voiced and voiceless , and went on to discuss ways that he and others had thought of to write this . actually , though , the use of those ipa voiced / voiceless or breathy voicing diacritics might not be quite right . the "" voiced "" initials in shanqhae lower register words are neither contrastively voiced nor contrastively unvoiced ; the apparent "" breathy semi-voicing "" seems actually to be feature of the + tone + , not the initials . some speakers pronounce it with the initial , some before the initial , some afterwards , some all the way through the syllable , and some not at all . davis ' symbol was a good idea at the time , though , because it expressed this lack of contrast vividly . i have met quite a number of linguists who have complaints about ipa or about the variety of systems in use , but these people hardly ever seem to be fieldworkers . i do n't believe i know any two fieldworkers who use phonetic symbols quite the same way , and most of them do n't seem to care at all . everyone seems to have different preferences ; well , so what ? some people , for instance , can't abide to write the "" h "" for aspiration + above + the line , and write it seemingly as a full segment . others leave the "" h "" out altogether , saying that ( in english , for instance ) it need not be written explicitly . the chinese tend to write aspiration with the reversed apostrophe of greek , probably continuing the tradition of older systems of romanization . the chinese , in fact , have a whole class of vowels - frictionless sibilants - that have n't made their way into ipa , as well as a special set of alveolo-palatal consonants . are these really necessary ? maybe not , but the chinese are not going to give them up ; be sure of that . for my part , i dislike plain schwa - i prefer to use the four schwa-area vowels ( close-mid and open-mid , rounded and unrounded ) that ipa now recognizes , and even before they became official i was using some of their current symbols , although i sometimes used special diacritics with schwa , too . these vowels are important in some of the areas where i work , in rural fwujiann . but every chinese dialectologist i know uses schwa like mad , and for a number of vowels that i consider quite distinct . we understand each other , though . fieldworkers are basically explorers . for the most part we do not go into the field to codify the known , but search for the unknown . we play with our symbols , try different ways of writing things , develop habits of transcription that are as distinctive as handwriting and reflect different ways of interpreting sounds . it is natural in these circumstances that different standards should take shape . fieldwork is an adventure , and transcriptional practice reflects that . i can't imagine why anyone thinks we need a single , "" democratically devised "" standard . ipa of some sort is good enough for most people who actually use it , and if someone does n't like it , he or she will borrow from some other tradition - american , perhaps - or invent another . if i want to look at that person 's notes , i will just learn the system - it might take as long as 10 minutes - and that will be that . where is the problem ? why should i trade my freedom of transcriptional expression for a rigid code ? why would that benefit me ? no , the "" chaos of multiple standards "" that stemberger mentions does n't bother me at all . there + are + two things that do bother me , though . one is the frequent changes in ipa that have been bandied about recently . when the kiel version of ipa was first promulgated , i was aghast at the large number of weird-looking symbols . then came the revision of kiel , and things were different again . i do n't mind adjustments , as long as they are introduced very gradually . like the agreement a couple of years ago that + either + way of writing "" g "" was acceptable - that only took a few decades to get straight . the idea that lots of changes have to be introduced and introduced right away frightens me a little . that is n't to say i do n't enjoy hearing the different proposals people advocate , but i will probably still stick to my own transcriptional habits , even so . the other thing that bothers me is the mob of systematizers , standardizers , formalists , and unificationists who seem to pop up everywhere in linguistics like dandelions by the side of the road . to my mind , formal systematization is the enemy of good fieldwork . and if a democratic vote + is + ever taken on the subject of phonetic alphabets , i hereby move that it be restricted to people who do a + minimum of 100 hours of fieldwork or acoustic measurement + every year for their own , fresh research . as for the rest of you - you are welcome to listen , enjoy the show , but please do n't try to tell me my business . david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmii @ u . washington . edu )

0,"lg & species the language & species discussion has not recurred this week , but i had already prepared the following , which i think would be of general enough interest to the recurrent misunderstandings about innateness and human language to publish on the list . since my last posting on the language & species discussion i have received some interesting comments and checked on the reference that i had in mind ( since i own a copy ) . the reference is a volume called "" speaking of apes : a critical anthology of two - way communication with man "" . eds . t . a . sebeok & jean umiker - sebeok . ny : plenum press , 1980 . in it is chomsky 's article : "" human language and other semiotic systems . "" pp . 429-40 . chomsky 's article is pretty much as i remembered it , but with a great many other observations on the nature of human language , characteristic of his concept of human language , which contrast / s with what the animal psychologists of the time had taught apes ( and perhaps even thought of teaching them ) , e . g . , potentially infinite embedding of phrases within other phrases . beyond that , he challenges the notion that human language is ( merely / primarily ) a system for ( social ) communication , which serves his notion of the inappropriateness of comparing human language with animal systems of communication for drawing conclusions about the evolution of human language ( and may also imply that it is a strictly human device for interpreting external stimuli and "" thinking "" ) . incidentally , my rereading of the article changed my earlier impression that chomsky lacked "" grace "" in not explicitly acknowledging the accomplishments and discoveries of animal psychologists , to a perception that such explicitness would be irrelevant and distracting to the points he wanted to make . of course he could n't help activating involuntary visceral hostility in some researchers when he accused them of lack of logic in their arguments , but that is another matter . most interesting was his final position that regardless of what apes may prove capable of learning , he saw evidence for a qualitative distinction between the human and ape natural intellectual endowment in the fact that humans acquire most ( syntactic ) properties of language without ( even the possibility of ) explicit teaching , while apes obviously do not , despite the "" evolutionary advantages "" ( c 's phrase ) that it would bestow on them . i particularly liked the last sentence of the following passage : "" now it is difficult to imagine that children learning english receive specific instruction about these matters , or even that they are provided with relevant experience . in fact , we find that while children make many errors in language learning , they never make such mistakes as these : they never assume , until corrected , that "" the candidates wanted me to vote for each other "" means that each candidate wanted me to vote for the other . in fact , relevant experience is never presented for most speakers of english , * just as no pedagogic grammar would ever point out these facts . * "" p . 432 to tell the truth , i do n't get the error in the example ( maybe because i ' ve never been corrected ? ) , but i get the point . it 's the point about anaphoric reference that i mentioned in the last posting ( though i think the passage is trying to rely on some point about syntactic embedding of anaphora of the type common at the time among generativists , cf . the parallel reflexive "" the candidate wanted me to vote for ? him - / herself [ unstressed ] "" ) . in any case , one might argue ( i would not ) that there is an anthropocentric bias inherent in chomsky 's perspective on the "" evolutionary advantage "" of human language - - i would suppose stemming from what i think is the evolutionary tenet that whatever promotes indefinite increase of the population of a species is an evolutionary advantage , since that is supposed to maximise the chance that at least some of the members of the species will survive to continue the reproduction of the species . i guess an objection might be that in some sense apes "" know "" something that we do n't know that makes them shy away from retaining or developing something like human language , e . g . , that the technological advances allowed by human social organization and motivation facilitated by language will eventually lead to our extinction , a notion that would probably have evoked more rhetorical sympathy in the mid 1980s when fear of nuclear holocaust peaked ( or more persistently but less clearly the malthusian notion that uncontrolled human population increase puts dangerous pressure on the ecological support system ) . i doubt such an objection has any chance of being taken seriously ( in the form just given at least ) by the scientific spirit . imagine the unimaginable that some human society ( any human society ) came to this conclusion and rejected human language as ultimately threatening to the species . even so , i would guess that the innateness hypothesis would predict that humans would still not be able to "" help "" learning and manifesting language ( manifesting - - ) learning by future generations ) , and if that would contribute to eventual extinction , too bad . nothing in evolutionary theory prevents "" defective "" aberrations from arising . the species with them would simply arise and then disappear ( relatively quickly ? ) . however , i ' m sure humans are constitutionally incapable of seeing the human language faculty as such an injurious aberration - - i can't . at worst i can only see it as a possible means of salvation from the jeopardy that some of our more sinister instincts may have placed us in . forgive me for even inventing what i consider an idle and repulsive speculation - - but i think it throws in relief what might be inferred in assessing chomsky 's ultimate argument as i understand it . the simple summation of chomsky 's argument is : if apes are capable of learning "" human "" language , why do n't they ( do it naturally - - like people do ) ? probably more interesting and arguable to the list discussion is chomsky 's point of distinguishing "" human language "" and "" language "" . chomsky sees human language as a subject for scientific inquiry with properties which are quite specific , including the syntactic properties of reference , embedding , etc . that we are all familiar with as current linguists . in contrast , my understanding of the article is that he sees "" language "" as a non-scientific concept , something vague and not even promising as a potential scientific field of inquiry . in this vein , he concedes that apes and many other animals may - - in fact , he does not doubt - - make use of symbolic systems ( semiotic systems ) apparently comparable in principle to the lexical component of language in some way , though less extensive , and , if i understand , less discrete ( in the linguistic sense of "" discrete "" ) . and he supposes that such symbolic systems in other animals may be related to shared intellectual capacities of humans and these other animals , but that with humans they interact with distinctive linguistic capacities ( among the latter i suppose the way lexicon fills in more abstract linguistic categories in grammatical derivations ) . in an illustrative passage ( p . 437 ) he objects to the gardners ' characterisation of teaching apes to use ameslan lexical signs as teaching them ameslan as a ( human ) language . by the way , he considers acquisition of the sign for "" and "" as trivial , with respect to comparison with human language . i do n't suppose that that is meant to detract from recognition of the apes ' ability to grasp this "" logical operation "" ( by human definition ) - - but that such recognition is irrelevant to an appreciation of what is distinctive about human language ( well , at least we now know that the "" logical "" concept "" and "" is not distinctive to humans - - the concept "" plural "" , then , probably is n't either - - more problematic is the concept "" dual "" as far as i know - - have apes been taught to count ? hey ! last time i looked i had three identical rubber ducks , now i only have two ! ) . in sum , then , chomsky has a very specific and single-minded notion of human language which allows him to immediately "" see through "" claims about animal manifestations of "" language "" , just as it had earlier allowed him to criticise ( and condemn ) skinner 's notions about the "" nature "" of human language . i think the usual difficulty in seeing his point is not so much in the persistence of linguistic debate about whether and to what extent "" autonomous syntax "" is a valid notion ( let 's not get into that here ) , but in the intuitive notion among linguists , as well as everybody else , that lexicon is a major "" part "" of "" human language "" . it is certainly not the part that chomsky associates with the distinctive innate human faculty of language . rather , the innate faculty is somewhere in the systems which organise combinations of signs , that "" somewhere "" being crucial to whether or not there is an evolutionary discontinuity between human language and animal potentials for "" language "" . of course , another source of resistance to the idea of an innate human language faculty is a generalised sneaking suspicion that anything that proposes to set humans apart from other animals in a fundamental way is self-deluding anthropocentric self - aggrandising propaganda , cf . the discredited ( i think ) argument against the heliocentric theory of the solar system that humans are the "" center "" of creation and therefore their location must be at the pivot of the material universe . while sneaking suspicions are certainly appropriate issues to bring up for something as informal as the ling . list discussion , it is not clear to me how it fits in to more formal scientific argument . misguided as a source of resistance would be the idea floated in the kant / innate discussion that a theory that something is "" innate "" is a killer to further attempts at "" explanation "" . the killer to explanation is the "" just "" in "" that 's just the way things are "" . on the contrary , take out the "" just "" and there would be nothing to explain if there were no "" that 's the way things are "" . if we get confused about this , it 's because , as scientists we don ' t know how things are , and our "" explanations "" are hypotheses to test if things are the way we think they are . i forgot what the context of kant 's discussion of "" explanation "" was , but in the context of "" pure "" reason it would have to be the "" just "" . in "" practical "" reason i suppose whatever aids remembering the "" facts "" is sufficient "" explanation "" . finally , a message from massimo piattelli - palmarini , director of the dept of cognitive science at the istituto san raffaele in milan , alerted me that among the discussion of comparisons between human and ape cognition relevant to language capacity , "" the truly definitive piece is by mark seidenberg and laura petitto in cognition , vol 7 , 1979 , pp . 177-215 . "" although this article was published before the volume i referred to above , it was too recent for most of the papers published in that volume to fully discuss , so that there are only glancing references to it in some of the papers . i still have n't read it yet , not that i ' ve even read most of the articles in the sebeok volume . incidentally , massimo reminded me that apes were indeed found to be able to recognise their reflections in mirrors , monkeys not ( and i think i read that in roger fout 's popular book about teaching apes to communicate with humans which came out in the late 70s ) . from what i gather , animal psychologists etc . are not ( or no longer ) hostile to the idea of a discontinuity between human language and what animals are capable of , but remain ( why not ? ) interested in discovering of what animals are capable of , and what that might suggest about human evolution . benji

0,"the "" hacek "" "" hacek "" is the diminutive of the czech word "" hak "" , meaning hook . if i ' m not mistaken , a lot of czechs attribute the innovation to the religious and linguistic reformer jan hus ( 1369 ? - 1415 ) . my sources , however , have him introducing a dot over the letters to indicate palatalization rather than a hacek . one of my czech pedagogical grammars claims haceks were appearing in czech manuscripts in the late 13th century , while another explains that the language 's diacritical conventions stabilized around the end of the 16th century , and that publications of the church of the czech brethren used haceks rather than hus 's dots . any of those who introduced the hacek could , in my uneducated opinion , have seen haceks in hebrew manuscripts like those described in alice faber 's recent posting , but we do n't know that . by the way , i ' ve recently seen haceks used in phonological renderings of swiss german in journals from berne dating around 1920 ( "" beitraege zur schweizerdeutschen grammatik "" ) . last year i also saw in the czech press one or two essays by czech jounalists stationed overseas who complained about the peculiarity of haceks ( e . g . , they ' re not found on most international typewriter keyboards ) and how it would make their lives easier if the czechs would adopt some more "" ordinary "" way of rendering the sounds in question . i very much doubt , however , that their opinion is much shared by their colleagues and compatriots . james kirchner

0,"6 . 136 language and species just a brief remark a propos of bemji wald 's comment on chomsky 's comment on whether apes can be shown to command ' reflexivization ' ; in particular the question of whether recognizing your image in a mirror as 's elf ' would be a sign of that ability . if it 's of interest , cats have a very peculiar relationship with mirrors . in my experience , most cats do not recognize images in mirrors , or tv , etc . as three-dimensional at all , and simply disregard them . but there are smart cats who do recogtnize their own images as cats in mirrors : but almost invariably as ' non-self ' . the typical reaction of a cat seeing itself in a mirror , if it 's a ' recognizer ' , is to bristle and hiss and go into defense-mode , or sometimes attack-mode . this of course raises what i like to call the dr doolittle problem : since we can't talk to animals we have to anthropomorphise and try to guess by analogy what they might be doing , but have no sense of what it feels like to be doing whatever . but in any case reflexivity is a bad example , because in general most animals do not have , in nature , any opportunity to see themselves ; animals that do confront mirror - like objects a lot ( say surface predators that hunt under water like herons , some cats , raccoons ) probably must deliberately as it were disregard the image they see , because they have to concentrate on refraction and what 's below the surface . roger lass department of linguistics university of cape town

0,"summary of names of days dear linguists , in the december 15 issue of linguist i posted a request for examples of deictic expressions for the names of days either side of "" today "" . here is the summary of what i obtained . the response was overwhelming - a total of 70 linguist subscribers sent replies . many , many thanks to all of you who contributed . quite a number of respondents supplied information on two or more languages . there was some duplication of languages , namely japanese , mandarin chinese , danish , french , german , russian and hindi . i now have examples of 48 languages , they are : anejom ( vanuatu ) , a = fee a = fee ( solomon is ) , azerbaijani turkish , basque , bauan ( standard fijian ) , brazilian portuguese , bulgarian , czech , danish , dutch , english , erromagan ( vanuatu ) , estonian , finnish , french , german , hausa , hawai ` ian , hindustani , ipili ( png ) , italian , japanese , kamhmu ? ( vietnam ) , ki - swahili , kope ( png ) , korean , lao / phasa iisaan , lenakel ( vanuatu ) , madarin chinese , malay , mauritian / seychelles creole , modern greek , modern hebrew , norwegian , polish , quechua , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo - croatian , slovene , sulka ( png ) , swedish , taiwanese , thai , welsh . my original interest in collecting such deictic expressions stems from a general interest in symmetry in language and language systems . most languages exhibit a symmetry in the number of deictic expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , however , some exhibit an asymmetry . c . s . levinson ( pragmatics , 1983 : 75 ) reports , "" the amerindian language chinantec has four named days either side of today ; japanese has three days back from today , and two ahead ; hindi has the same word for yesterday and tomorrow . "" ( levinson gleaned this information from : fillmore , c . j . ( 1975 ) . santa cruz lectures on deixis , 1971 . mimeo , indiana university linguistics club . ) i have not personally been able to get a hold of this the fillmore reference - living in the academically isolated south seas does have some drawbacks ! if any of you have a copy of this publication , i would be very interested in obtaining photocopies of the section on ` time deixis ' . of course , i will reimburse you for the cost of postage and photocopying . anyway , a symmetrical deictic system of diurnal units / spans seems to me logical , though i ' m not sure i can verbalise the reasons . the reported asymmetry in the japanese system seemed to me a bit odd . especially that the asymmetry was lop-sided towards the past ( see below for reasons ) . upon further examination , i discovered that the japanese deictic system for diurnal units does seem to be symmetrical ; it has + 3 and - 3 either side of the present diurnal span . the expression ` siasatte / yanoasatte ' meaning + 3 days from "" today "" is not known to quite an number of native speakers of japanese . they appear to be used infrequently and ` yanoasatte and yaneasatte ' are considered to be dialectal ( at least in relation to the tokyo dialect ) . indeed , the lecturer in japanese in my department ( herself a native speaker of japanese ) was not aware of these expressions until she looked them up in her dictionary . another interesting consideration in all of this is the question as to the number of diurnal units before and after today that languages recognise . what is the maximum / minimum number of units ? also , what is the average number of units ( or most popular system ) ? answers to these questions ( based on my small sample ) below . one respondent asked the following very interesting question : "" if you reach the level of , let 's say , 5 ( days after present diurnal span ) , does this also have the non-specific reading ` at some point in the not-to - far-away future ' in those languages ? "" the only language in my small corpus that has + 5 and - 5 diurnal units in its system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . i will have to ask my source for erromangan to answer this question . there is an inherent problem in determining the number expressions for diurnal units . this is determining whether the expressions are lexemes or phrases . many languages seem to have "" lexicalised "" ( for want of a better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . other languages , like for example the english expression ` the day before yesterday ' , have retained the phrase structure . one respondent supplied me with a lengthy discussion on the lexeme / phrase issue . she cites the case of bulgarian ( i hope she won't mind my including her discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents an [ interesting ] situation with regard to the phrase / lexeme issue because it does n't have a real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit . "" that / yonder day "" ) vchera - 1 dnes 0 present diurnal span utre + 1 vdrugi den + 2 ( lit . "" other day "" ) so the same form ' pozavchera ' in bulgarian ( with stress on the penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress on the final syllable ) perhaps does n't look as strange because one would n't expect ' po ' to require any particular case ending . however , again we have what looks like a preposition with an adverb , which should not exist as a phrase . bulgarian "" tomorrow "" is ' utre ' . but "" the day after tomorrow "" is ' vdrugiden ' - - i . e . , the phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . "" on ( the ) other day "" , written without spaces in between the individual words . should this be considered a word simply on orthographic grounds , though ? is it a prepositional phrase or an adverb ? of course the boundary between prepositional phrases and adverbs is very fuzzy to begin with . bulgarian "" the day before yesterday "" , in contrast , is what looks like a noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - "" that day "" . no preposition ' v ' ( "" on "" ) here . so should this be considered just an np or a prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used the same way as ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax go onja den ' - - "" i saw him [ on ] the day before yesterday "" . it seems to me that what 's written as a noun phrase here is really an adverb , like ' vdrugiden ' or like russian ' pozavchera ' and ' poslezavtra ' , the only difference being that the other three adverbs are formed from prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has no preposition . it would sound strange to call it a prepositional phrase , because , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , it contains no preposition . so i would call it an adverbial phrase . ( time expressions in slavic languages are commonly in the accusative , and that may be the origin of ' onja den ' , but since modern bulgarian has lost its nominal case paradigm for the most part this makes it harder to determine the status of phrases like this one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( "" each - acc week - acc "" ) , which means "" every week "" in an adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't have specific words for "" the day before the day before yesterday "" - - that would be , i think , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( "" on the day before the day before yesterday "" ) , but of course speakers would avoid that and just would say ' predi dva dena ' ( "" two days ago "" , lit . "" before two days "" ) . the same would be true for ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( "" on the day after the-day - after-tomorrow "" ) , but speakers would say 's led dva dena ' ( "" in / after two days "" ) . so i think it may be very difficult here to draw a demarcation line here between the grammatical categories of words vs . phrases . [ end of quote ] quite a number of languages ( especially slavonic and germanic languages ) allow recursion of prepositions / prefixes to "" add on "" to the already existing deictic expressions . the extent to which this recursion can be practiced is limited only by pragmatic constraints . here are some nice examples : rumanian : ras-ras - ras-alaltaieri ( ? ) - 5 ras-ras - alaltaieri ( ? ) - 4 ras-alaltaieri - 3 alaltaieri - 2 ieri - 1 azi / astazi 0 present diurnal span miine + 1 poimiine + 2 ras-poimiine + 3 ras-ras - poimiine ( ? ) + 4 ras-ras - ras-poimiine ( ? ) + 5 etc . dutch : ( eer-eergisteren ) + 3 eergisteren + 2 gisteren - 1 vandaag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen ) + 3 danish : ( i for-forgars - 3 ) i forgars - 2 i gar - 1 i dag 0 present diurnal span i morgen + 1 i overmorgen + 2 ( i over-overmorgen + 3 the - 3 and + 3 forms are rather colloquial , but nevertheless perfectly idiomatic . further recursions of prefixes / prepositions are only used in jocular ways , and predominantly by children . finally , if you have read this far , you are about to be rewarded with a summary of the data i have at this point . number of diurnal units either side of "" today "" : symmetrical deictic systems - 1 0 + 1 no examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 23 examples - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 14 examples - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 3 examples - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - erromangan ( vanuatu ) asymmetrical deictic systems - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 3 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 1 example - malay - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - hausa - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 1 example - colloquial spanish ( southern spain ) it 's interesting to note that no language in the sample employs the - 1 0 + 1 system . and the majority of asymmetrical systems are lop-sided towards the + side of the present diurnal span . why this should be so , i do n't know . however , this sample is very small and perhaps a larger sample would show no such lop-sidedness towards the + "" today "" side . are the languages that show a lop-sidedness in a state of change ? most languages have a symmetrical vowel system e . g . the same number of front vowels as back vowels . however , there are quite a number of languages with asymmetrical vowel systems . what lies behind this asymmetry ? the answer to this question may lie in the following scenario [ from : crowley , t . ( 1992 ) an introduction to historical linguistics , oup , pp . 200-201 ] suppose that in a language with a nice symmetrical five vowel system : i u e o a the vowel / e / beocomes raised towards / i / and ultimately merges merges with / i / . the resulting asymmetrical system : i u o a will put structural pressure on the system , and , in time , it would not be surprising to see / o / merging with / u / . if a system becomes asymmetrical ( or uneven ) so as to create some sort of ` gap ' , then a change is likely to take place as a way of plugging that ` gap ' , thereby re-establishing an even ( or symmetrical ) system . if this is indeed a natural process in phonological systems , perhaps analogous processes occur in other systems , like temporal deictic systems . a language with an asymmetrical temporal deictic system may be in the process of historical change and the ` gap ' plugged in due time . japanese may be a language that is in the process of losing its + 3 deictic term . if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to see whether , in due course , this "" imbalance "" is "" balanced "" again by the loss of its - 3 deictic term . i do n't know how valid any of this is , i ' m just speculating . anyway , back to symmetry . the most symmetrical system of all is that found in hindi : tarso - 4 narso - 3 parso - 2 kal - 1 aaj 0 present diurnal span kal ( bihaan ) + 1 parso + 2 narso + 3 tarso + 4 where there are not only an equal number expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , but the expressions on either side are the same . distinction between "" before today "" and "" after today "" is made through use of past or future tense of the verb . in looking at a language 's temporal deictic system i guess we must not fail to take account of a number of important linguistic / cultural aspects . among these would be : * the culture 's view of time . is it a linear view or a cyclical view ? * the language 's tense / aspect systems . * the historical development of its deictic expressions in short , we can't study deictics in isolation . we must look at how it meshes grammatically with the language . i would be very interested in any of your views on the reasons for symmetry and asymmetry we find in this area of deixis . also , if you are interested in adding to my list of languages , i 'd be very grateful to receive your contribution . thanks again to all those generous people who sent me so much interesting data and opinions . yours today , tomorrow and . . . jan tent department of literature and language school of humanities the university of the south pacific p . o . box 1168 suva fiji tel : ( 679 ) 313900 ext . 2263 fax : ( 679 ) 305053 e - mail : tent _ j @ usp . ac . fj = 09

0,"innateness i made the following claim in my 22 - dec-94 posting : "" if x happens because y is innate , then this is a perfectly valid explanation for x 's occurrence ; if x happens for some other reason , then it 's not valid . "" i thought that this claim , being tautologous ( if we know what causes x , then we ' ve got an explanation for it ) , required no justification , but apparently i was wrong , since david powers ( 13 - jan-95 ) objects , on the basis that ` "" innateness "" amounts to saying "" because it [ ' ] s a fact of life "" . . . and saying that "" we are born with it "" is not an explanation . ' that is , apparently , even if we know that we are born with y , and that x happens because of this , we still have n't explained x 's occurrence . huh ? ( granted , we may now want to explain why "" we are born with y "" , too . but surely we ' ve got an explanation of some sort here , however partial it ultimately turns out be . and it 's got to be better than the relevant alternative : x happens because we learn x on the basis of "" general learning principles "" . ) i do think he has a legitimate objection to something , however , as discussed below . but first : perhaps i can put it another way , as i have elsewhere in the context of a fuller discussion ( "" on explaining the phoneme : why ( some of ) phonology { \ bf is } natural "" , bls 11 : 25-38 ( 1985 ) , p . 31 ) : a claim about innateness ( or lack thereof ) ` . . . should [ be ] evaluate [ d ] on the same basis [ as any other ] : does the evidence support the claim about innateness or does it not ? it would be just as wrong to claim that something that is innate is not , as to claim that something that is not innate is ' . it is true that making a claim about innatenes without evidence reveals "" laziness of the mind "" , but so does making a claim about lack of innateness . powers continues : ` . . . the science comes when we show ( a ) the sufficiency ; ( b ) the necessity & ( c ) the source of the posited [ innate ] constructs . ug is concentrating on ( a ) and there is a tendency to deprecate those who are interested in ( b ) and ( c ) - which go beyond the bound set by innateness . ' if ` ug ' really is out there running around making innateness claims solely on the basis of sufficiency arguments ( and i do n't doubt that some folks do this , alas ) , then i can understand why innateness has gotten a bad name . translating into syllogism-ese , such an argument would have the following form : "" y is innate "" entails x ; x is true ; therefore y is innate . logicians have a name for arguments of this form : "" affirming the consequent "" ; this is a classical logical fallacy . but , while individual practicioners may be guilty as charged , it is at least not always the case that innateness claims are made with disregard for ( b ) : arguments from "" the poverty of the stimulus "" , the unavailability of negative ( ungrammaticality ) evidence , and the ( alleged ) lack of errors by children that violate structure dependency are all clearly cases in point . ( see , e . g . , chomsky 's _ reflections on language _ . ) note further that my requirement in the above quote is stronger than requiring just ( a ) and ( b ) : "" y causes x "" entails "" y is necessary and sufficient for x "" , but not vice versa ( e . g . , if z causes both y and x ) . and , while i agree that deciding to pursue ( c ) should not be grounds for deprecation , neither should , i would think , deciding not to pursue it . this elephant is too big for any one "" blind man "" to figure out alone ! don churma , dept . of english , ball state univeristy , muncie , in 47306

0,"summary of q : articles two weeks ago i posted the following query : ) a system of articles is an innovative feature of a number of languages . are ) there any examples of languages that have lost their articles ? i would also ) be interested in creoles , especially , say , if both ( all ) source languages ) had articles , but the pidgin / creole turned out lacking them . thanks to the following for responding : lars borin david gohre john e . koontz jeff marck deborah d . kela ruuskanen achim stenzel shigenori wakabayashi dave wharton of the 8 replies , only one was an actual response to my query . lars borin ( lars . borin @ ling . uu . se ) pointed out that ) finnish romani is a language which has lost its articles completely . the ) loss is almost certainly due to finnish influence , as are many other ) traits of modern finnish romani morphology and syntax . moreover , as ( colloquial ) finnish may seem to developing an article system using the demonstrative * se * ' that ' ( def . ) and the numeral * yksi * ' one ' ( indef . ) , it is interesting to note that lars has ) noticed in finnish romani texts that there are forms of the demonstrative ) pronouns 'd auva ' ( this ) and 'd ouva ' ( that ) , which are ) ( a ) reduced phonologically and indeclinable ( reduced versions of the ) nominative plural ) ; the forms are : 'd ala ' and 'd ola ' ( while the ) nominative plurals of 'd auva / douva ' are written 'd aala / doola ' ) ) ( b ) used much as spoken finnish 's e ' , i . e . perhaps representing the first ) ( or maybe second [ . . . ] ) stage in a development from demonstrative to ) preposed definite article . importantly , the definite articles used to be ' o ' ( sg masculine ) , ' i ' ( sg feminine ) , and ' e ' ( plural , both genders ) , hence nothing like the demonstrative pronouns . now , let me elaborate somewhat on my reason for inquiring into this matter . disregarding massive language contact ( i . e . "" hey , this is the way we say things around here , and you 'd better start doing so too ! "" ) and / or creolization ( i . e . "" ok guys , let 's start all over again . we ' ll begin with lexical categories , then . . . "" ) : if it were the case that there is a universal tendency that languages acquire articles , but do not loose them , then why should this be so ? if we take a configurational approach to noun phrase interpretation , we could say that articles , and hence their semantics , are associated with a noun phrase internal functional projection in much the same way as some linguists would assume an association between tense ( and other verbal inflections ) and a clausal functional projection . ( in essence , i ' m talking about some kind of a dp - analysis . ) since possible noun phrase interpretations differ minimally across languages ( i guess ) , we would then assume that in languages without articles , the functional projection associated with the semantic properties in question would have phonetically empty heads . the possible tendency of acquiring articles could then be explained as a strive to fill this / these head / s with overt elements . unfortunately , i cannot say that i so far have any reason to be convinced about this line of reasoning , but i can't see any obvious reason to give it up either . however , i am ready to be butchered . i should probably read the following references provided by john e . koontz ( koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ) ) greenberg , joseph h . 1978 . how does a language acquire gender markers ? pp . ) 47-82 . in : universals of human language , vol . 4 , ed . jos . h . greenberg , ) et al . stanford , ca : stanford university press . ) discusses evolution of gender marking from articles and articles from ) demonstratives . see also : ) greenberg , joseph h . 1981 . nilo - saharan moveable-k as a stage iii article ) ( with a penutian typological parallel ) . journal of african languages and ) linguistics 3 : 105-112 . those interested in definiteness , especially with respect to english and finnish , should consult the following work provided by deborah d . kela ruuskanen ( druuskan @ cc . helsinki . fi ) . ) chesterman , a .

0,"sum : c gemination ( syntactic ) content - length : 10885 summary of data on syntactic gemination of consonants a couple of weeks ago i posted a query on what i termed "" syntactic gemination "" , for which i got information from no fewer than 15 respondents . i am very grateful to them all . here they are , listed in alphabetical order : list of the 15 respondents : prathima christdas ( prathima . christdas @ um . cc . umich . edu ) vincent decaen ( decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca ) lance eccles ( lance . eccles @ mq . edu . au ) maik gibson ( llrgbson @ reading . ac . uk ) david gil ( ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet ) ralf grosserhode ( afrikanistik2 @ uni-bayreuth . de ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) marcia haag ( haag @ monk . nhn . uoknor . edu ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) bruce nevin ( bnevin @ lightstream . com ) john phillips ( john @ ccyi . ccy . yamaguchi-u . ac . jp ) mari siiroinen ( siiroinen @ cc . helsinki . fi ) norbert strade ( lingnost @ hum . aau . dk ) mark verhijde ( mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl ) caroline r . wiltshire ( wiltshir @ minerva . cis . yale . edu ) the term "" syntactic gemination "" was not specific enough , as i had in mind only gemination at word boundaries , and not word-internal gemination at morpheme boundaries . nevertheless i will mention such cases as have been pointed out by respondents . besides , in my haste , i had forgotten to mention classical greek , which i had also taken into account in the preliminary version of my paper . here are the data : a syntactic gemination at word-boundary a . 1 - italian this is the "" raddoppiamento sintattico "" of central and southern italian . nevertheless the conditions under which this appears seem to vary considerably among the dialects ( and the speakers ? ) . for instance , the example "" a casa "" [ a ' kkasa ] , taken from lepschy & lepschy ( 1981 ) is not accepted in the dialect of an italian colleague at my university . a . 2 & a . 3 - biblical hebrew and phenician in these languages the definite article / ha / triggers gemination of the initial consonant of the following word ( except for certain consonants ) . for instance , in bh , we have / su : s / ( horse ) , but / ha ssu : s / ( the horse ) . the same would seem to apply to phenician ( see the grammars by segert , van den branden ) , although we have only one epigraphic attestation in punic . the explanation is that a proto-article is reconstructed as * / han / or * / hal / , so that * / hal su : s / ) * / has su : s / , then reinterpreted as / ha ssu : s / . this hypothesis has been connected with the arabic data : the final c of the article / ? al / is assimilated to the initial c of the following word ( at least for the socalled "" sun "" cs ) . for instance : / ? as samak / ( the f ish ) . 46or arabic , gibson adds this : in tunisian arabic there is a clearer case ( @ is schwa ) : shaaf - @ t 's aw - 3sf ' "" she saw "" shaaf - @ tt-u 's aw - 3sf-3sm ' "" she saw him "" the doubling is done to maintain syllable structure , but this is not the20 normal way . we would normally expect the elision of @ , to shaaf-t - u , but20 this does not happen in the 3s feminine past . a . 4 - classical greek in attic greek word-initial / r - / goes to / rr - / under certain conditions after a word ending in a short final v . in epic texts , or in other dialects , this gemination is extended to other sonants : / l - , m - , n - / . we even find / pp - / attested in boeotian these four languages were the only instances known to me when i posted the query . incidentally , note that they are different from the cases of latin "" hic "" and "" hoc "" , which were pronounced / hikk / and / hokk / before a word beginning with a v . the form / hokk / is original ( and / hikk / analogically modelled after it ) , so that diachrony forces us to say that / hokk / is simplified into / hok / before a c - initial word . here are now the additional data kindly supplied by my respondents , which i paste freely . a . 5 - finnish ( eccles , siiroinen , strade ) there is consonant gemination at word boundaries in certain cases in finnish . it is morphologically conditioned though it is "" syntactic "" . several morphemes or forms trigger it : imperative 2nd person singular ( ota ' take ' / otas se ' take it ' ) , allative case ( annan sinulle ' i - give to-you ' / annan sinullek kirjan ' i - give to-you a book ' ) , most of the nouns ending in - e ( kirje ' a letter ' / kirjet tuli ' a letter arrived ' ) and so on . other examples : in some negative forms : * en mene sinne * ( i do n't go there ) , pronounced20 * en menes sinne * negation + v - stem + there verb ( go ) 20 1 . sg . the same in imperative : * a "" la "" mene sinne * ( do n't go there ! ) , 20 pronounced : 20 * a "" la "" menes sinne * neg . verb imp . 2 . sg . also in the so called "" 1 . infinitive "" : * ha "" nen pita "" isi tulla ta "" nne * ( he / she ought to20 come here ) , pron : * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tullat ta "" nne * 20 inf . 1 here 20 the background for this gemination is the historical loss of a final consonant in the suffix-less verbal stem and in the mentioned infinitive form . this consonant was assimilated to a following consonant . while it disappeared without any trace in an end position or in front of a vowel , the gemination of the following consonant was retained . this feature is n't marked in orthography . a . 6 & a . 7 - tamil and malayalam ( christdas , wiltshire ) tamil has gemination of word initial stops following words with some case markings ( accusative at least ) . a brief account can be found in christdas , prathima ( 1987 ) "" on constraining the power of lexical phonology : evidence from tamil "" in mcdonough , j . and plunkett ( eds ) proceedings of nels 17 , volume 1 : 122-146 . 20 syntactic gemination is also found in malayalam , a closely related language . a . 8 - celtic languages ( phillips ) the celtic languages have "" mutations "" , changes to the beginnings of words due to their syntactic environment . types of mutations include prefixing of h or n to a vowel and voicing , devoicing , nasalising , etc . , of consonants . one of the mutations in old irish was gemination . the welsh spirant mutation is historically cognate with irish gemination , e . g . ci "" dog "" , but tri chi "" three dogs "" , cath a chi "" a cat and a dog "" , though gemination in old irish occurred in a much wider range of environments . some of the mutations in breton are realised phonetically as gemination , though spelt otherwise . on other cases of c - mutation , see the mention by verhijede below ( fulla , southern paiute ) . a . 9 - the kelantan dialect of malay ( gil ) in the kelantan dialect of malay , agents of passive clauses ( ie . "" by "" - phrases ) are marked not with a preposition ( as in standard malay ) , but , rather , by gemination of the initial consonant . cb : if i understand this correctly , the preposition has been ellipted ? b - word - internal syntactic gemination word - internal syntactic gemination seems to be widespread , probably more than gemination at word-boundary . as pointed out by nevin , in many languages , some phonotactic effects apply only in certain syntactically defined domains , for example , in roots or in verb stems , but not in affixes . hale adds that the number of languages which show this process is quite large . for instance there are some oceanic examples . at any rate , both sanskrit and ( if the meter is to be believed ) and preclassical ( homeric ) greek show such processes . here are a few specific instances : b . 1 - classical greek word - internal / r / is geminated to / rr / after the augment or after a vowel in compounds , variably . b . 2 - choctaw ( haag ) choctaw ( a muskogean lg of n . america ) has an inflectional form ( for aspect marking ) that involves deformation of the stem such that a medial consonant is geminated , or / y / is inserted an geminated if there are not the requisite number of syllables . so we have falama ` return ' becoming fallaama ` finally return ' while ala ` arrive ' becomes ayyaala ` finally arriv e ' . b . 2 - sakao ( guy ) sakao is a language spoken at espiritu santo , , in vanuatu ( formerly new - hebrides ) . when the direct object is incorporated in the verb , the initial c of the verb is geminated . examples , with son 3d to hunt / shoot with a bow , enes 3d fish : moson enes 3d he is fishing fish with a bow ( now ) but : mossones 3d he fishes fish with a bow ( generally ) , il peche a l ' arc analysis : mv - 3eme p . sg . realis sson20 nes ( ( enes with disappearance of the compulsory article v - , then simplification of the two n 's inro one n ) nb : o 3d open o ( ipa "" open o "" in pullum & ladusaw , p . 117 ) e 3d open e ( ipa epsilon ) b . 3 - biblical hebrew gil adds this on hebrew : in biblical hebrew the 2nd binyan ( "" pi99el "" ) is formed by reduplication of the 2nd root consonant , together with the appropriate choice of vowels . now in most part , the binyan system is considered "" derivational "" and hence not , strictly speaking , syntactic ; however , in some cases , the 2nd binyan is the "" transitive "" or "" causitive "" of the first , in which case gemination ( plus vowel pattern ) does have a syntactic function . let me end by a more theoretical note , quoting verhijde : your question touches upon the fields of interaction between morphology-syntax and phonology ( prosody ) . now as far as i know , all c - gemination is in itself strictly phonological . thus if i understand your question correctly , you wish to find out whether there are languages that appear have morphological / syntactic triggers for c - gemination . there is a huge bulk of material on sandhi - effects , as for example the italian rs case you mentioned in your query . perhaps ellen kaisse ( 1985 ) , _ connected speech _ may be of some help . now with respect to your query : i was thinking ( from a phonological point of view ) that c - gemination is really : share melody . or in more abstract terms : share [ x ] . if this is correct , then for example c - mutation ( like in fula , southern paiute and celtic languages ) under syntactic considerations may become very interesting for you . thans again to all of you who generously answered my question . claude boisson universite lumiere , lyon , france ( claude . boisson @ mrash . fr )

0,"words that are their own opposites : sum , cont 'd . here are some explanations of three famous types of auto-antonymy . bob fradkin gives us the auto-antonymy of verbs of covering / uncovering , chuck bigelow follows the english blackening of indo - european ' white ' , and david gamon explores how modal expressions may come to mean their opposite . * * * bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) writes : dust is part of a series of noun-verb conversions related to coverings of things . if the noun gives a covering that is natural to the thing , then the verb means "" remove the covering . "" if the covering is imposed , the verb means "" put the covering on . "" so you get "" shell an egg "" "" peel a banana "" but "" paint the furniture "" "" wax the floor . "" dust is interesting because it can go either way : "" dust the furniture "" ( a sort of natural covering to be removed ) vs . "" dust the crops "" ( put stuff on them that they did n't have and would n't unless humans put it there ) . i mentioned this in my english grammar book "" stalking the wild verb phrase "" ( univ . pr . of america 1991 ) at the end of chp . 3 . * * * chuck bigelow ( bigelow @ cs . stanford . edu ) writes : ) from historical linguistics , a well known example of a word 's meaning shifting to its opposite is english "" black "" , of which the indo - european root is * bhel - ' to shine , flash , burn , be white ' etc . another modern reflex of * bhel is "" bald "" - ' having a shining or white head ' . from a variant of * bhel - , * bhelg - / * bhleg - ' to shine , burn ' comes germanic * blakaz ' burned ' , and thence old english "" blaec "" - ' black , that which has been burned ' . nifty . ( i ' m using calvert watkins ' dictionary of ie roots , houghton mifflin , as reference . ) * * * david gamon ( gamon @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) writes : enantiodriomia refers to the diachronic process of acquiring an "" opposite "" meaning , and i suppose a word having two such meanings would be an enantiodrome . i learned this , by the way , from professor matisoff here at berkeley . enantiodromia of modals / attitudinals the first example of such a word i had drawn to my attention is * doubt * , which historically has a meaning such that to doubt that something be true meant to suspect it to be true . in some parts of northern england , i ' m told , it still has this meaning . this was brought to my attention by professor bill stewart at cuny . another example i ' m familiar with is the english modal * must * , which is reconstructed as meaning "" to have freedom or space "" ; the gothic cognate meant "" to be free or have permission ( to do something ) . "" there are two classes of explanation offered in the literature for this particular example of enantiodromia . first explanation : negation drops out klaren ( 1913 ) and antinucci and parisi ( 1971 ) propose that the semantic shift took place in a negative context , as follows : neg ( free to do x ) - - ) compelled ( neg ( do x ) ) given the equivalence of a lack of freedom to do something and a compulsion to not do something , an innovative "" compulsion "" semantics was reanalyzed from the "" freedom "" semantics in a negative context with concomitant scope change of the negative operator . the reanalysis is made esepcially perspicuous given a & p 's notation , which decomposes the older meaning of the modal ( freedom / persmission ) into the primes neg ( bind ( neg ) ) : if one is free to do something , then one is not bound to do it ; if this is negated , the first two negs cancel out to leave only the narrow-scope neg , with a resultant meaning of bind neg or "" compelled not "" with narrow-scope neg , as follows : cause ( x ) ( neg ( neg ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) ) ) [ = j . may not go out ] - - - ) cause ( x ) ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) [ = john must not go out ] the same sort of explanation could be applied in reverse to the german modal * duerfen * , which underwent a semantic shift from an original "" necessity "" or "" compulsion "" semantics ( cf . mod . germ . * beduerfen * "" need , require , "" * duerftig * "" needy , poor , lacking "" ) to the modern "" permission "" meaning : bind ( neg ( do x ) ) - - ) neg ( free ( do x ) ) however , the a&p notation fails to link the conservative and innovative senses in a natural manner . second explanation : antithetical nature of modality the other kind of explanation has been proposed by breal ( quoted in bech 1951 , p . 19 ) , visser ( 1963-73 , p . 1797 ) and traugott ( 1989 ) , and basically proposes that permission is used as a polite way of imposing obligation , with the implication subsequently being semanticized , or the originally indirect speech act giving way to direct , conventionalized coding . one might see the same sort of shift occurring in present-day english in contexts that suggest that this sort of explanation may indeed be valid , as in "" you may leave now . "" one can see from this , at least , that what counts as an "" opposite "" is largely a matter of the scale one implicitly chooses along which to arrange the items at issue , or the specific semantic prime upon which one chooses to focus . also , one would n't even think of conceptualizing the innovative meaning as antonymous if most of the conservative meaning were n't being preserved intact . another example is * prove * , which in middle english meant something like "" to test , "" or in a legal context , "" to put on trial . "" when the expression "" the exception proves the rule "" was coined , it quite logically meant that an exception or counterexample to a generalization or claim makes you question the generalization or that the exception so to speak puts the rule on trial . as the verb * prove * shifted its meaning 180 degrees , the expression , illogical though it then became , was preserved simply because it 's so handy - - whenever someone presents counterevidence to your claim , you can write it off as "" the exception that proves the rule "" ! ( it 's interesting , by the way , how many "" folk "" justifications there are of the sense of this idiom - - but that 's another story . ) references antinucci , francesco and domenico parisi ( 1971 ) . on english modal verbs , cls 7 : 28-39 . bech , gunnar ( 1951 ) . grundzuege der semantischen entwicklungsgeschichte der hochdeutschen modalverba . copenhagen : ejnar munksgaard . klaren , g . a .

if they can , what should the ` optimal ' representational theory look like ? if they cannot , what exactly is the residue of derivationalism that we still need ? we invite all papers with these or related topics ( a more complete description of the conference topic can be found below ) both for and against purely representational approaches to phonology . we expect to be able to ( partially ) reimburse travelling expenses and lodging for our speakers . furthermore we are proud that bruce hayes and geert booij have already agreed to be our invited speakers . deadline those interested in presenting a paper ( 40 minutes talks , 15 minutes discussion ) should send 5 copies of a two page abstract ( 10 anonymous ; 1 camera-ready , with name ( s ) , affiliation ( s ) and contact address , including e-mail ) to : marc van oostendorp or ben hermans , grammaticamodellen , tilburg university , postbus 90153 , 5000 le , tilburg , the netherlands . abstracts must be received by 1 may 1995 . abstracts with page text considered too condensed to be read will be rejected without review . no email submissions accepted . for additional information contact b . j . h . hermans @ kub . nl or m . voostendorp @ kub . nl . topic of the conference during the past few years the main focus of attention in phonology seems to have been shifted from derivational to representational models , such as prince and smolensky 's optimality theory , goldsmith 's harmonic phonology and burzio 's pes - model . yet generative phonologists have accumulated substantial evidence for derivational analysis . in standard lexical phonology , for instance , derivationalism plays a role in several ways : the model is divided into a lexical and a postlexical component , the lexical component itself is divided into several lexical levels , some lexical levels are cyclic and every affix starts its own cycle and , finally , the phonologicals rule within every cycle are ordered . the question is how we have to evaluate all these derivational instruments in a representational theory of phonology . the distinction between lexical and postlexical phonology seems to be least controversial . most optimality theory analyses seem to accept at least this remnant of derivationalism . yet one could imagine a more radical version of a purely representational theory in which the distinction between word-level and phrasal phonology is accounted for in an appropriate theory of phonological domains . in any case , the question remains as to how we have to evaluate the traditional criteria for lexical-postlexical distinction ( exceptions , sensitivity to morphological and syntactic boundaries , etc . ) in a theory of constraints and constraint ranking . similar questions could be asked about the internal level ordering within the lexical component . can all analyses which used to be framed in terms of lexical levels be reframed in representational terms ? and to what extent can a theory which makes extensive use of lexical levels still be called ` representational ' ? most discussion on derivationalism within optimality theory seems to have been concentrated on the issue of cyclicity . it has been demonstrated that some cyclic analyses can be replaced by an adequate theory of alignment between phonological and morphological structure . is this everything that needs to be said about this issue ? are , for instance , cyclic versions of ot feasible and desirable ? similarily , considerable effort has been put by several researchers into showing that strict cyclicity as a theoretical concept is superfluous or that it can be replaced by a theory of underspecification . whether this is an adequate answer to all derived environment effects is another topic we hope to address . finally , we expect that even at the finest grained level of derivationalism , viz . phonological rule ordering ( both intrinsic and extrinsic ) interesting questions remain unanswered . in particular all cases of what used to be known as counter-feeding and counter-bleeding relations seem to us still to be open for discussion . all of these questions have considerable conceptual import , yet it seems to us that they can ultimately be answered empirically . the issue of derivationalism is one of the interesting challenges that optimality theory and the other models mentioned earlier pose . we hope to receive many abstracts dealing with it .

0,"re : 6 . 1070 , disc : sex / lang , re : 1023 in the ongoing discussion of the "" epicene he "" , i think that perhaps we are making some headway on certain issues , but all kinds of new loose ends keep unraveling . what seems clearly established is that the 18th century grammarians of english did not invent this usage , since ( a ) it had existed in english for centuries , and ( b ) it seems to be a linguistic universal or something close to it , not a peculiarity of english however , i do not see why anyone should call me "" misandrist "" ( or "" mysandrist "" ) . if it is because my name could easily be taken to be a woman 's name ( although i happen to be a man ) , that would really be too bad . if it is because of my acceptance of the common view that almost all or perhaps all societies are in some important sense male-dominated , then that too would be inaccurate . i also believe that for several centuries of us and brazilian and so on history white people held black slaves and not vice versa , but that does not mean i hate white people . the whole issue of the sense in which it is true that men have dominated human societies is certainly in some respects a subtle one , and one could certainly argue that this dominance has done us little if any good , but i do not see how one can deny that it is a fact . however , for the purposes at hand , this is not germane . what is relevant is ( a ) the linguistic fact that languages that make any kind of gender or sex distinction in pronouns or verb forms or anything else , as a rule use the male or masculine forms as unmarked forms for persons of either or unknown gender in some constructions ( which may differ from language to language in detail ) , and ( b ) the anthropological fact that all or nearly all human societies make social distinctions based on sex which go beyond reproduction , breast-feeding , and the like , and ( c ) the further anthropological fact that the male roles / activities are routinely perceived as somehow superior , dominant , better , normative , whatever ( regardless of whether they really are , which is a completely different issue ) . so what it all boils down to , again , is that i maintain that it makes no sense whatever to discuss the origin of the epicene he phenomenon in the context of the story of english prescriptive grammar , but only in the context of the way in which perceptions of sex roles have informed the structure of language ( as of any other institution ) . alexis manaster ramer

0,"sycophants : fig "" show-ers "" ? i do n't do much etymology , but : several readers have claimed that _ sicophant _ is derived from the greek words for ' fig ' ( sikos ) and 's how ' ( phaino : ) . the first part is surely correct , but the second seems problematic , since the relevant participle forms of _ phaino : _ would be present _ phainont - _ and aorist _ phanont - _ . without a greek grammar or dictionary at hand , i would suggest rather that we look at the athematic greek verb _ phe : mi _ ( doric _ pha : mi ) 's peak ' , which does have a participle _ phant - _ . so maybe the sicophant is the ' fig-talker ' rather than the ' fig-shower ' . the semantic connection , of course , would be that his words were sweet to the ear ; and certainly sicophants do more sweet-talking than fig-showing . what do you think ? has this etymology been proposed ? and if it has been proposed and rejected , why ? leo a . connolly foreign languages & literatures university of memphis connolly @ msuvax . memphis . edu formerly "" memphis state university ""

1,"hi ! * * * this is not spam ! * * * my name is matthew . i make a habit of deleting mail i have not yet read , as i ' m sure you do also . please read this one though , you might find this interesting . i recently lost my high paying job from a major computer corporation due to their loss of a major contract . they messed up , but that whole dep ' t of 15 people including myself are hung out to dry . corporate america at it 's finest . i have not had luck yet finding another job , as my skills were very specific to that company and not really worth anything to another company . during the time i worked there , i also bought and sold real estate like those guys on tv . ( yes , you can do that and make it work for you too ) the key is i made it work . i was fairly successful until the "" nightmare on pleasant st . "" as my freinds and i call it . . . i lost most of my money in that one bad deal and i was no longer financially secure and i relied heavily on my income from my former job . as you ' ve already heard , i lost that too and i started to look for other things i could make money to help me get back on my feet . so , i started to read all of the junk that people have mailed to me . let me tell you , i can't beleive some of the things out there . . . what a waste of time . until i saw this . hold on . i know you are ( like i was ) ready to stop reading right here . i implore you not to . i ( like you ) am not some non-educated fool . i have made much money for myself in real estate , which is not an easy business . i am a rather competent business man . at least finish reading this until the end . * * better still : print this letter and read it in comfort over , and over here is what i saw . . . * i only needed $ 20 extra dollars to try this * this is making money for people who at lease tried a little , so why not me too ? in desparation , i sent the four 5 dollar bills and got the reports . as i always have , i made this work for me too . i took much time and effort to learn about e-mail ( which is a great and free tool ! ! ) and how to send lots of it . now , 19 days after my first mailing of this , i have received roughly 8 , 450 responses . ( trust me , when my fiance ` saw 8 , 450 5 dollar bills on the kitchen table , she no longer laughed at me for trying this ) i wrote a report of my own showing step by step how to do the same which i will give to you for free as a helping hand so we can all continue this success . i will show you every step of cutting , pasting , editing this letter to include your name and address , etc . here is my special offer to help you . . . . as long as my address , basquiat at the evanston po box is on the list below i will send the step-by - step instructions and 100 , 000 e-mail addresses to anyone who orders any report from me . it took some time and expense to put this list together so all i ask is that you add another $ 5 for handling the addresses . the instructions for e _ mailing are free . they will come to you in a . txt format ( which i will teach you how to use in the instructions i ' ve put together ) and less than 2 % will be duplicates . you will get the list of addresses with your report . the first 160 people who order a report from me will receive a different set of addresses . this is my gift to you to help you get started . . . . i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as i am . you do n't need to be a whiz at the computer , but i ' ll bet you already are . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! add this e-mail to ' favorite places ' by dragging the heart at the upper right corner of this window to the heart / folder picture next to the file cabinet . that way , you will have a copy of this for future use . go for it now !

0,"the ldc united nations corpus in linguist 6 . 973 and a parallel query to the corpora list , rapahel salkie asked some questions about the un parallel corpus from the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) . before these queries appeared , a response to an earlier query from dr . salkie had already gone out privately from rebecca finch . i certainly urge anyone with experience in using the un corpus to respond to dr . salkie as well . we have also placed a sample of 24 ( out of 21 , 000 ) parallel documents , each in english , french and spanish , in : ftp : / / ftp . cis . upenn . edu / pub / ldc / data _ samples / un _ par _ sample . tar . z these samples should also be accessible , along with quite a bit of other ldc information , from the www page at url http : / / www . cis . upenn . edu / ~ ldc let me add a few words about ldc prices and costs , since dr . salkie 's message expressed the normal human annoyance at being asked to part with money , both in the case of the un corpus and another ( not yet published ) ldc parallel text corpus , the canadian hansard . the ldc membership fee for a university is $ 2 , 000 , and for this fee everyone at that university can get an unlimited and perpetual research license for everything that the ldc publishes during the year of membership . thus you can join the other ninety current members of the corsortium and get not only the forthcoming hansard corpus , but also the other twenty or so databases published this year . for the same amount , a university can get the un corpus and the other 15 databases published in 1994 . whether a particular database , or collection of databases , is worth that amount of money is of course a matter of individual or institutional judgement . we feel that $ 2 , 000 , which is roughly the cost of a moderately configured pc or an international conference trip , is not out of line even for university researchers . speaking for myself , i have a great deal of sympathy for the effort to provide research resources free or at minimal cost , and i have been involved in several successful efforts to bring out such databases over the years , including the acl / dci cd-rom , the eci disk , the celex disk , and others offered in the range of $ 25 - $ 200 . these efforts rely heavily on volunteer labor and other donated resources ; in several cases they have also relied on cash donations from the ldc . however , volunteer labor is rarely available in the needed quantities ; and of course ldc - supplied cash , as well as the existence of the ldc as an organization , depends on income from somewhere . the money that we get from memberships and database sales is a crucial part of the picture - - - without it the ldc would not exist , and neither would either of the databases under discussion . to highlight the point , the history of the u . n . publication is worth reviewing briefly . we decided to try to publish the u . n . archives because translation researchers wanted parallel texts . after concluding several months of negotiations with un representatives and lawyers for both sides , we paid for a nj - based computer consultant to go into the un offices at night so as to make backups of the archives from dismountable disk packs for a long-obsolete wang word processor onto cartridge tapes . this required several months and cost a considerable sum ; we had to use this particular person because he was an authorized service rep for the un facility . then came six person-months of work at the ldc . we had to decode the proprietary and undocumented wang backup format , and the equally proprietary and undocumented wang character set , typographical codes and file structures . we re-organized the entire archive and translated it into wordperfect format , and published a certain number of cd-rom s in this form for the purposes of the un - - - this was part of the agreement that we made with them for access to the data . then we translated the documents into iso-8859 - 1 with sgml markup ( including a working dtd , for those how care ) , and worked out the correspondences among documents . this was far from trivial , since each un language had been entered separately , with no coordination of file names , file dates , or even division of documents into files , and there were tens of thousands of documents per language . this work was mainly done by dave graff , whose salary the ldc pays . we are not likely to recover the costs of acquisition and production of this database through sales and memberships bought for its sake . we subsidize our members by cost-sharing with government grants , or by using income from more popular or less expensive databases to cover unrecovered costs of less popular or more expensive ones . in the case of the forthcoming hansard corpus , which dr . salkie also mentioned , the cost of acquisition and publication has been similar to that of the u . n . material , and the same remarks about subsidies apply . whether a particular database is worth a certain price is a matter of individual taste , but as a matter of simple arithmetic , the fees charged in these two cases are unlikely ever to cover the costs incurred . for those who have read this far , i would like to repeat a standing offer that has been in existence since the beginning of the ldc . if you are interested in cd-rom publication of a language-related database that is plausibly of interest to our membership , and this database is reasonably close to being in shape to publish , we will pay the costs of production , using your label design or one worked out with you ; we will give you up to a hundred copies to do with as you see fit ; we will put the item in our catalogue at whatever price you choose ; and we will remit to you any resulting income in excess of our production costs . the copyright ( if any ) will remain with you , and we will handle any user license arrangements that may be necessary , sending the signed licenses to you . we have published several databases on this basis , and are planning to publish several others , although ( from past experience ) the chances of making back our production costs are no better than even . best wishes , mark liberman myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu 619 williams hall university of pennsylvania phone : 215-898 - 0141 philadelphia , pa 19104-6305 fax : 215-573 - 2175

0,"sum : risk content - length : 15606 i was surprised to receive so many replies on my comments about "" risk "" . so far they include : alison huettner bart mathias john r . lee scott delancey deborah milam berkley tim beasley eric pederson claudia brugman martha o'kennon andrew carstairs - mccarthy sandi michele de oliveira ( trying to get sick = about to get sick ) debra r west balsa stipcevic i decided to post a summary for several reasons : 1 ) my comments made some respondents sufficiently insecure to wonder what other respondents thought . 2 ) i did n't want anyone to get the idea that my comments might represent an authoritative or majority opinion . 3 ) although i usually try to respond individually to everyone , i get tired thinking of different ways to say the same thing . overwhelmingly , but not unanimously , the respondents disagreed with me . alison huettner represents the majority response : "" funny , i have the opposite take on "" risk "" - - to me "" he risked losing the game "" sounds fine and "" he risked winning the game "" takes a little more processing . "" unusual was agreement , such as represented by tim beasley "" both sound good to me . the first paraphrases "" he ran / stood the risk of losing the game "" , "" he placed himself in risk of losing the game . "" the second , "" he placed in jeopardy . at risk . his winning of the game . "" as implied above , both sides of the atlantic want to disown me , e . g . , from bart mathias of california : "" no thoughts , but i thought i 'd report that i expected to see a . uk or . au or something in your address when i checked it after reading your message . i for one ( born and raised in california ) find "" risk winning , "" at least at the moment , causes a double-take reaction . to me it is equivalent to "" be in / put oneself in danger of . "" however , from john r . lee at an edinburgh address : "" this is interesting . i was very surprised to see "" he risked winning the game "" ! perhaps as a british english speaker ( ? ) , to risk losing the game seems a much more natural concept . "" larger context makes me think john considers himself , not me , to be the british speaker . in any case , andrew carstairs - mccarthy of new zealand made a similar comment . back on the american side , scott delancey agrees with the majority and adds some interesting grammatical comments : "" this seems * really * strange to me . my reactions are exactly the opposite of yours . a clausal complement of _ risk _ is * always * a negative and undesirable result . i can't even interpret _ he risked winning the game _ , except in some strained context in which winning would n't be a good thing . "" _ risk _ can have a positive np complement - - _ he risked his fortune _ is perfectly ok - - but not a clausal one , i . e . this could be expanded to _ he risked losing his fortune _ , but ? ? _ he risked winning a fortune _ is impossible for me . "" eric pederson and claudia brugman informed me that chuck fillmore has written a paper on "" risk "" . claudia writes : "" [ by ] sue atkins and charles fillmore which i do n't know whether they ' ve published ( or indeed finished ) yet , but they talk about these two meanings of the word in terms of the selection as complements of different aspects of the conceptual / semantic frame : one is where the desired outcome is selected , the other is where the "" collateral "" is selected . "" i have n't seen the paper yet , but it was comforting to the extent that it seems to take cognizance of my impression . however , i suspect that the "" collateral "" means a simple np expressing the desirable object , as scott allows , and not a clausal complement . thus some replies suggested that "" he risked his life "" would have to be expanded into "" he risked * losing * his life "" . i have to admit that that sounds better to me than "" he risked * keeping * ( ? ) his life "" . nevertheless , my theory is that in my rush to learn english i made the following logical leap . "" to risk your life "" is to risk something good , so you should risk "" winning t he game "" , not "" losing the game "" . risking fines , death , imprisonment and cancer were later experiences for me . i ' m quite sure "" risking life "" was the first ex pression i heard . by the way , i ' m not at all sure that i differ from others on our favorite gallicism of "" running the risk of / that [ something bad happening / will happen . "" , so that 's a different expression . i kinda doubt that genuine dialect differences are respo nsible for differences in "" risk "" - - only idiosyncratic differences in generalisations , some of which survive contradictory data learned later - - an interesting point that has been made before in language acquisition theory . among the interesting comments i received which suggest to me that relatively discrete semantic splits may result from such processes , and even become genuine dialect features is sandi michele de oliveira 's observation that in south texas the expression "" trying to get sick "" can be used for "" about to get sick "" . i wonder if "" trying to rain "" could mean "" threatening to rain "" in such dialects . of possibly different origin is the ambivalent serbo - croatian verb "" sumnjati "" ( = "" to doubt "" or "" to suspect "" ) . balsa stipcevic indicated that : "" sumnjam da je on to uradio . "" can have two meanings : 1 ) "" i suspect that he did it . "" 2 ) "" i doubt that he did it . "" here i suppose that the verb might have started off neutral to the belief status of its sentential complement , but it remains interesting that there is such a glaring pragmatic ambiguity in what a speaker might be implying . maybe english "" wonder "" is similar . "" i wonder if he did it "" . if he says he did , then the sentence would seem to suggest that i doubt it , but if he says he did n't , it would seem to mean that i doubt that . i ' m not gonna torture myself trying to figure out whether the same context - ualisation differences work for "" i wonder if he didn ' t do it "" , but maybe someone / body else wants to give it a shot . i wrote back to balsa that i hoped his comment on this verb is more generally agreed upon by serbo - croatian speakers than my comment on "" risk "" . - - benji

0,"release of agfl home page this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page ; we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands

0,"phonetics texts dear linguists , last month i posted a query on phonetics texts suitable for a 10 - week undergraduate course . i received many helpful responses from : chuck coker , yoshi asano , marc picard , charles read , darlene lacharite , nigel love , geoffrey nathan , steve seegmiller , don churma , frances ingemann , peter ladefoged , hal edwards , and one linguist who preferred not to be listed . thanks to all of you ! the book most often recommended is peter ladefoged 's , but others are also recommended in cases where the course is focused on the description of english only . geoff nathan pointed out that there are hypertext programs with examples stored as sound files that go with ladefoged 's text ; the edwards text has accompanying workbook , instructor 's manual and lab tapes . marc picard very kindly sent me the bibliography he gives to students in his class . i hope he does not mind that i have added to it the items referred to in the other replies i received to create the enclosed summary bibliography . call numbers are from marc 's list , and are those from libraries in montreal , for those of you lucky enough to live there . again , my thanks to all who replied ! susan meredith burt here is the combined list of references : abercrombie , david ( 1967 ) elements of general phonetics . edinburgh university press .

0,"j . r . firth 's ' context of situation ' thanks to the following people who kindly responded to my inquiry into work which attempts to apply j . r . firth 's notion of ' context of situation ' to studies of discourse : tom craven gudula stegmann graham mcgregor joe foley koenraad kuiper richard ogden in summary , it appears that although firth 's notion is familiar to many sociolinguists , discourse and conversation analysts - as evidenced in references typically appearing in overviews on the notion of ' context ' - surprisingly little work has been , or is being , actually undertaken on the topic . a reference where this phenomenon is exemplified is the introductory chapter in duranti , a . & goodwin , c . ( 1992 ) ( eds . ) rethinking context . cup . koenraad kuiper reports that he has a forthcoming paper which offers a reappraisal of the origins of the term ' context of situation ' ; graham mcgregor has conducted an ( unpublished ) study of person-reference which incorporates firth 's notion into his analytical approach . i shall be happy to inform readers of the list of my future uncoverings of applied firthian linguistics . alan firth aalborg university , denmark

0,"asl dictionary on cd-rom my recent query concerning the new american sign language ( asl ) dictionary on cd-rom generated a substantial response , both from this list and from slling - l . i have summarized the main points of these responses below . please bear in mind that i have not seen the products in question . the dictionary reviewed on pbs is the american sign language dictionary on cd-rom by martin sternberg and is distributed by harpercollins . the following is the positive point that recurs in people 's messages : - - it is at the moment the only published asl dictionary that includes motion videos of asl signs , which serves to disambiguate unclarities in printed representations . the following are the negative points that recur in people 's messages : - - the dictionary is based too heavily on english , being essentially an english - to - asl dictionary . this both makes it hard ( at times , impossible ) to get an idea of the internal structure of the asl lexicon , and makes it less useful to native signers . ( there is , however , some categorization into semantic groups . ) there are also more specific problems arising from the failure to make asl distinctions that are not made overtly in english ( e . g . english "" lecture "" is used as a headword , while the asl equivalent is specifically a verb , not a noun ; classifiers are almost completely omitted ) . - - the dictionary is based on sternberg 's book-form dictionary of the early 1980s , and fails to take account of recent developments in the study of asl . - - there may be technical quality concerns , but since i have n't seen the product i ' m not in a position to judge . it seems to work better on more modern machines , and the mac version seems to work better than the windows version . alternatives : the following other cd-rom asl dictionary projects were drawn to my attention : - - multemedia dictionary of asl ( mm-dasl ) , release planned for summer of 1995 . this dictionary is based generally on the work of william stokoe ( who is involved in the project ) . it allows direct lookup of asl signs , incorporates recent linguistic work on asl , and is assisted by a panel of native asl users . for details , please contact sherman wilcox , university of new mexico ( wilcox @ mail . unm . edu ) . - - asl dictionary on cd-rom developed by dennis cokely at linstok press , 4020 blackburn lane , burtonsville , md 20866 , and alpha and beta tested by ken rust at madonna university , who should be contacted for further details ( rust @ smpt . munet . edu ) . thanks to : jacqueline anderson , nancy frishberg , marian macchi , mark a . mandell , joyce mcdonough , chris miller , karen mistry , becky moreton , cindy neuroth - gimbrone , steve seegmiller , mark seidenberg , barbara sensiba , dan slobin , leslie h . stennes , sherman wilcox , and the authors of the many messages that were forwarded to me from slling - l . - - bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu

0,"aaas what follows are the minutes of the meeting of section z - linguistics and the language science - - held during the atlanta aaas annual meeting . the section committee hopes that this will be of interest to all linguists and once again urges any linguist not yet a member of aaas to join and select section z as their priary affiliation . ( a membership form follows the minutes ) v . fromkin , section z , secretary = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = section z - - linguistics & the language sciences section meeting - february 17 , 1995 , 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 pm marriott marquis , atlanta , ga . minutes attendance : retiring chair barbara lust , chair , richie kayne , chair - elect stephen anderson , chair elect 1995 sarah thomason , secretary , vicki fromkin , members of steering committee : paul chapin , ilse lehiste , paul chapin , section z representative to aaas council , arnold zwicky , and 10-25 individuals ( 20 signed the attendance sheet ) . ( 1 ) the meeting was called to order and chaired by chair richie kayne . the attendees were asked to introduce themselves . ( 2 ) the minutes of the feb . 21 , 1993 section meeting were distributed and approved . ( 3 ) the results of the last election were reported : sarah ( sally ) thomason was elected chair - elect for 1995 , and david caplan was elected member at large 1995 - 1998 . the members of the steering committee for 1995 ( as of february 21 , 1995 ) therefore consist of : retiring chair richie kayne , chair stephen anderson , chair elect sarah thomason , secretary victoria a . fromkin , members - at - large : david caplan , paul chapin , ilse lehiste . arnold zwicky remains as the council delegate through 1996 . the chair expressed the appreciation of all members of section z to retiring chair barbara lust ( who will serve on the council in 1995 ) and david pesetsky . ( 4 ) four sessions were sponsored by section z at this meeting : bilingualism : when is the best age to learn a second language ? ; endangered languages ; linguistic science and language technology : machines and human language ; structures of language : batons for cognitive science and neuroscience . in addition , section z cosponsored a session organized by the psychology section : instincts to learn . kenneth hale presented one of the topical lectures - - the scientific cost of the global loss of linguistic diversity . ken hale s lecture and the session on endangered languages received a great deal of interest from the press . ( this issue made national press coverage by the time of the section meeting , ) the section extended its gratitude to the session organizers and speakers , and to ken hale for their efforts in bringing linguistics to the general scientific community at the aaas . ( 5 ) dr . susan speece , chair of the department of biological sciences at anderson university , anderson in , who has been appointed as education liaison from the education section to section z was introduced . she distributed copies of life science standards and curriculum development for k-12 and reported on the work of the science education reform committee of the national research council and asked for suggestions and input from our section regarding science education k-12 and also undergraduate science education . , a discussion followed in which it was announced that stephen crain is heading a committee of the linguistic society of american on linguistics in the curriculum which is also concerned with the teaching of linguistic science in the schools . it was suggested that crain be asked to contact dr . speece . individuals were urged to view the poster paper linguistics in the schools : developing an epistemology of science by maya honda and wayne o neil on display from 10 : 30 to 3 : 30 on saturday , february 18 , in the marriott south exhibit hall . this poster paper is directly related to the subject under discussion . ( 6 ) budget . vicki fromkin reported on the budget situation . up to this meeting , section z received $ 2500 / annum from the aaas office which was supposed to cover the travel expenses of the section officers for the annual meeting , refreshments , and any expenses of the ssponsored sessions ( organizers and speakers ) that could be provided . last year we offered no support to symposia speakers . thus , this year after subtracting the probable expenses of the officers , the section budget total came to approximately $ 2500 . symposia organizers sent their requests to vicki fromkin . after she determined the cheapest possible fares of the speakers , she divided the sum so that no speaker who had requested funds would suffer financially more than the others and recommended to the aaas staff that these sums be disbursed . this leaves the section with a zero balance . at the planning committee which she attended , vicki reported that the staff had decided to change the section budgets . the expenses of the officers would no longer be deducted from the section allocation but would be borne by the central office . however , the sections would now receive much lower allocations ; section z will only receive $ 1000 / annum . it is urgent that symposia organizers inform their invited speakers that there is little if any money for expenses and speakers should attempt to find money elsewhere . ( 7 ) 1996 aaas annual meeting , baltimore , maryland , 8-13 february 1996 . proposals for sessions are due april 1 , 1995 . a general discussion was held regarding sessions to be sponsored by section z . the section agreed that it would like to see the following session organized . ( note that these are not necessarily the titles of the symposia to be submitted but rather signify the contents we would like to see presented . ) ( the name in parenthesis after each is the person designated to contact the proposed organizers ) i . language in the schools . proposed organizers wayne o neil , maya honda , walt wolfram ( wayne o neil ) ii . new technology ( e . g . mri , ct , pet ) in the study of the biology of language . proposed organizer : david caplan ( v . fromkin ) iii . the structure and acquisition of sign languages . proposed organizer : ursula bellugi ( v . fromkin ) iv . child language acquisition . proposed organizer : lila gleitman ( v . fromkin ) v : connectionism vs . symbolic systems models of cognition . proposed organizer : paul smolensky ( steve anderson ) ( following the meeting some of the members of the section steering committee proposed that geoffrey nunberg also be asked to submit a proposal on prescriptivism / the equality of dialects / english only legislation or such related issues . fromkin and anderson will contact him ) barbara lust informed the section that we also received a tentative idea for a possible symposium from lisa menn ( working with both lsa and asha ) which would be on theoretical , modeling and therapeutic studies of the acquisition of phonology . this was referred to sharon goldsmith of asha for further consideration for their support . ( 8 ) 1997 aaas annual meeting , seattle , washington . an opening discussion on possible sessions for the seattle meeting was held it was suggested that individuals should submit proposals to the nsf to fund sessions on reports of current research which would be of interest to the scientific community . such proposals should be submitted to paul chapin by no later than july 15 , 1995 in order to have a funding decision from nsf by december 1995 , in time to submit a session proposal to the aaas program committee . ( 9 ) membership . as of the time of the meeting , 169 members of aaas had selected section z as their primary affiliation , and according to mike spinella ( aaas staff , who attended the meeting briefly ) , 141 had designated section z as their secondary affiliation and 205 as their third . this total of 515 satisfies the aaas requirements for establishing section z as a permanent section of the aaas . in the words of mike spinella you re in ! . however , it is important that we continue to increase the members whose first affiliation is to our section . we would like to see that number grow to a minimum of 400 . in the discussion on methods to increase membership it was suggested that we ask the lsa if we can include a letter from the section chair and secretary in the regular mailings to linguistic department chairs asking if each department would subsidize the membership fee for one member ( probably the chair ) of the department . if the chair is already a member , another person should be designated , who could be elected by the faculty or determined in some other way . this would substantially increase our membership . sharon goldsmith from asha announced that she would be willing to place a notice in the asha newsletters and publications which go to 80 , 000 of their members . paul chapin agreed to draft a letter to send to asha for this purpose . it was also suggested that a membership form be included in the mailings . she also thanked section z for their support of the symposium on bilingualism which was organized by asha and introduced david kean , of the asha research and tehcnology committee . . barbara lust suggested that we contact all the international organizations such as lagb who supported the formation of the new section and ask them to publicize the section and urge their members to join . the question of the cost of joining aaas was discussed . there was confusion as to the cost of joining as a supporting member ( without receiving science ) particularly for foreign applicants . mike spinella assured us that supporting memberships cost $ 35 . 00 for us , and all non - us members . on the application form this $ 35 . fee is stated only for spouses of members , but we were assured that it is for anyone who joins as a supporting member . ( 10 ) endangered languages . michael strauss spoke on the importance of our establishing ties with non-linguists concerned with conservation and diversity , i . e . conservation biology , etc . david harmon of the george wright society of the world parks congress was introduced and told the group that until recently he did not realize the extent of the problem re maintaining linguistic diversity and the dangers facing endangered languages . he supported the suggestion that linguists concerned with this issue work together with other groups interested in cultural and biological diversity and endangered species . ( 11 ) at the 1994 meeting , it was agreed that it was important for linguists to submit research articles to science . this was reiterated . it was pointed out that one cannot complain about the contents of the journal and the heavy weighting toward biology if we do not submit articles . should they consistently be rejected we would then have grounds for complaint . ( 12 ) vicki fromkin announced that the international congress of linguists ( organized by the permanent international committee of linguistics , better known by its french initials cipl ) would be held in paris , in july of 1997 . ( 13 ) michael strauss , the director of annual meetings on the aaas staff and estrella m . triana , the senior program associate , aaas directorate for education & human resources programs were introduced . estrella triana announced that 1998 was the 150th anniversary of aaas and urged members to support the issuing of a aaas commemorative stamp . she also announced the fund raising drive for a new building , and reminded members that sections of the aaas were entitled to hold meetings in the aaas building in washington , dc . the meeting was adjourned submitted by v . fromkin , secretary section z = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = membership request form mail to : aaas - po box 2033 marion oh 43306-2133 or fax to ( 202 ) 842 1065 name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ membership category : ( includes 51 issues of science ) * regular member $ 97 * postdoctoral $ 72 ( payment required with order , ) * student $ 50 ( payment & student id required ) supporting member $ 35 ( does not include science ) check enclosed _ _ _ bill me later _ _ _ ( regular members ) visa _ _ _ _ master card _ _ _ _ credit card number _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ exp date section z primary affiliation : _ _ _ _ ( check here ) * all include 51 issues of science .

( 2 ) why are such people as the gardners , savage - rumbaugh , chadwick , etc . so irritated at us ? on the first question , all of my respondents , as well as david pesetsky , seem to be agreed that the most impressive ' linguistic ' performance of chimps and gorillas reported in the literature is at a level roughly equi - valent to that of a human child of approximately two years of age , but that the anthropoids seem to be unable to develop beyond that stage . in particular , they show no evidence for syntactic structure , nor for any ability to distance themselves temporally or spatially from the referents of their statements . i received statements such as the following : ' the most successful of the apes have managed to reach more or less the level of children in the two-word utterance stage . the size of the lexi - con is about the same , as is the combinatory ability . ' ' the apes master a refined system of communication , and are capable of some abstract thinking , but lack the very fundamentals of human language ( recursiveness , structure-dependency , parsing into constituents , etc . ) . ' ' the chimps mostly have a lexicon , and a rudimentary syntax that lets them distinguish between actor and patient , but that 's about all . . . . the chimps ( a ) have no morphology to speak of ( b ) can't use displacement of the message ( i . e . , can't talk about the past or future , or something that happens / ed in another location ) ' [ at a venture , i would guess that they can't handle contrafactuals either . ] ' it is claimed that the ape "" utterances "" lack grammaticality or syntax . the apes can make the correct symbolic associations , but have no sense of grammatical patterning . in two and three "" word "" sentences , the order of the elements is variable and each element maybe repeated any number of times in any order and independently of the rest ( sequences like give banana give kanzi kanzi banana kanzi give , etc . ) ' one of my respondents , partly on the basis of hanns own occasionally frus - trating experiences resulting from the geographical proximity of an insti - tution presumably devoted to the 's tudy ' of anthropoid language , made some critical statements about the scientific methodology of some of this research . in particular , after referring to hockett 's 16 'd esign fea - tures ' of language , hann remarks : ' the proponents ' claim that [ chimps ] do have cultural transmission , because washo taught her son , does n't bear up under much scrutiny ; washo had to be rewarded to learn every sign and her son has not learned as many , nor passed them on to any other chimp . i see what the chimps learned as the equivalent of a pidgin ; but creoliza - tion never took place . ' which implies ( 1 ) that anthropoid ' language ' ac - tually corresponds to the skinnerian model refuted by chomsky in his fa - mous review as regards human language and ( 2 ) that it is not sufficiently ' natural ' to the anthropoids for them to feel motivated to transmit it successfully . some of my respondents addressed some of the wider theoretical and metho - dological issues relevant to linguistics implicit in this discussion . one opined ' that some dismissal of ape language research is partly , and unconsciously , motivated by a turf-protection instinct . we ' re all alrea - dy uneasy about the fact that there are certain subfields of linguistics whose importance we acknowledge but which we ' re not personally terribly well-versed in . . . . i think many theoretical linguists breathed a sigh of relief when terrace announced that [ the chimp ] nim had n't really learned human language at all . it meant that they did n't have to worry about mo - difying their theories to fit ape language data . ' another said , ' most linguists do n't really care ( at least not consciously ) about whether apes can learn language as such , but they do care deeply about whether lan - guage is "" sui generis "" and innate or not . . . . as far as linguists are concerned , we ' re divided over chomsky 's claim that language is a geneti - cally-programmed module , rather than an area of knowledge which is han - dled by general cognition . if apes can't learn language at all , that supports the chomskyan view ( which presumably involves some cataclysmic mutation say 100 , 000 years ago , or at least since we split off from the other primates ) . if they can learn some of it , we have evidence for ge - neral cognition ( where apes are presumably less well endowed than us , so you 'd expect partial success ) . ' in further discussion we agreed that this argument only held if we accept a 's trong ' version of the relevant dichotomy implicit in the innateness hypothesis , according to which human linguistic ability is overwhelmingly if not completely independent of general human cognition . i pointed out that even if chimps are demonstrably distinct from us on a genetic level they still share over 98 % of our dna . so even if they share some of our linguistic ability it might mean that they also share some of the distinc - tive genetic endowment that provides it . a more effective test would be on cetaceans or pachyderms , which are nowhere as nearly related to us as chimps are but which appear to have roughly comparable cognitive levels . if they also share a certain amount of our linguistic ability , that would indicate that at least that amount is probably dependent more on general cognitive ability than on any specific genetic endowment . if chimps , dolphins , elephants , whatever , can't master human language but have other modes of communication * not isomorphic * with ours but of * comparable com - plexity and flexibility * , then this would give us the opportunity to stu - dy how much of human language is necessary to the general phenomenon of language and how much is incidental and of relevance only to our species ; it might also enable us to talk about the ' innateness ' of human linguistic ability in terms that would not be offputting to geneticists . on the second question , the basis for the irritation towards academic lin - guists on the part of the proponents of anthropoid language , there was some consensus that they were working with an overly simplistic concep - tion of what constitutes language , and were offended that we refused to share it . typical were the following remarks : ' all the [ proponents ] of animal language , and of its continuity with hu - man language , assume that human natural languages simply * are * the result of communication and use . . . . the basic design of human languages is * not * dictated by use , and we can easily conceive of species that would possess a * radically * different design for language and would communicate just as well , if not better . ' ' the gardners et al . have an extremely elementary grasp of what is real language . they think that if they have a lexicon and bare syntax , that 's all there is . their other argument , that the apes have "" real "" sign lan - guage , is also pitiful . . . . the approach trivializes both oral languages and sign languages . ' there was , however , some acknowledgment that some of the ' blame ' for this state of affairs belongs on our doorstep . the ' trivialization ' just men - tioned was claimed to be due at least in part to inadequacies in state - ments by linguists in the 50 's and 60 's . one respondent in particular pointed to an inveterate tendency to try to identify a single , defining , characteristic as the sine qua non of human linguistic ability , rather than accepting the fact that such important distinctions are often proper - ly made on the basis of mosaics of characteristics . in particular , much research in anthropoid ' language ' has apparently focussed on the ability of chimps and gorillas to coin novel expressions , unanticipated by their human teachers / handlers , on the basis of a finite number of memorized ' lexemes ' and some basic combinatorial principles . this effort has suppo - sedly been motivated by early assertions by academic linguists that what distinguishes human language from all other forms of animal communication is its creative ability . when the gardners , etc . , demonstrate that their apes are capable of similar creativity and we then say , ' very nice but that 's not language ' , they are understandably miffed . in response to this , i think what is necessary is greater tact , humility , and honesty on all our parts . we need to admit up front that we ( or our predecessors ) have oversimplified in the past , and give credit to the ape researchers for helping to elucidate the issues . and we need to make it clear that what chimps , gorillas , and two-year - old humans share is in some sense a * rudimentary * linguistic ability , but not equivalent to what adult humans do . in short , we need to increase everybody 's awareness of the inherent rich - ness and complexity of human linguistic behaviour , which to my mind means we need to devote more time and energy to introductory courses in general linguistics ! harold schiffman reports some encouraging success in this direction with a course on linguistic anthropology at the university of washington . further discussion on the issues raised here is welcome , either in perso - nal communication with me or in general discussion on the list . i hope in the not too distant to be able to post a short list of references to published literature on this subject . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *

0,"ipa vs americanist symbols i am at last drawn to reply to the debate on ipa versus ' americanist ' traditions in phonetic transcription . i was , frankly , somewhat surprised by the tone of the original submission , suggesting that the ipa 's refusal to use hachek / wedge symbols for palatoalveolars was an example of racism ( both anti - americanism and anti-slavicism , and no doubt anti - diacriticism ) . now we learn that the ipa itself is an anti-democratic conspiracy , and we need a new campaign led by american organisations to make phonetic transcription 's afe for democracy , apple pie , and the american way ' ! ? a couple of points need to made in this regard , i think . first , it is not true that the ipa is not used in north america . what we have here is maybe not euro - centrism , but phonology / dialectology centrism ! clinical phoneticians and speech pathologists in north american nearly always use the ipa ( yes : long esses / zees , jods , and the cardinal vowel system , and all ! ) indeed , some departments of linguistics / phonetics operate within the ipa tradition ( e . g . university of victoria bc ) . on the other hand , virtually all phonologists on this side of the atlantic use the so-called americanist symbols . the divide , therefore , is not as has been portrayed . if phonologists tend to use one set of symbols , and phoneticians another , is that really such a problem , as often they are concerned with different levels of description anyway ? even if phoneticians cannot agree , is this also such a problem ? can raising the fears of racial discrimination and undemocratic conspiracies really be justified over relatively trivial distinctions in symbols that anyone trained in the area knows about anyway ? the second point concerns the debate on the symbols themselves . as i have just noted , the difference between certain symbols is surely not a fundamentally important one ; but i would like to speak in defence of the ipa non-hachek versions . leaving aside the fact that these symbols do have a long history , i ( do ) feel that a unit symbol is preferably than a composite one . ( unlike the original posting , it always seemed obvious to me that the hachek symbols were s / z etc plus a diacritic ) . granted that the ipa is not always consistent on this point , a unitary symbol approach avoids confusions as to the nature of the s - s distinction . one may have to counter students ' feelings that [ s ] is really only a type of [ s ] which is reinforced by the spelling ; it does n't help if the symbol looks also like a 's ort of s ' . we might also look at the difference with [ j ] versus [ y ] for the palatal approximant . on the surface , this looks fine , as the [ y ] spelling is familiar ( but surely anglocentric , and not in line with slavic / germanic etc usage ? ) . however , this choice then leaves us with a problem for a high front rounded vowel . if we can't use [ y ] then we must resort to [ u "" ] . the diacritic [ "" ] , however , is also commonly used in many traditions to stand for centralized . this transcription also suggests that [ u "" ] is a variety of [ u ] , and that [ o "" ] is a variety of [ o ] etc . the use of independent symbols leaves open the relationship between lip-rounding and tongue position , which the 'd iaresis ' versions do not . however phonetic transcription develops in the future , let 's avoid throwing around accusations at other users or bodies . utopian schemes of universal orthodoxy in this area are surely unneccessary if not unsound . to be realistic , most ipa users ( wherever they ' re based ) are unlikely to surrender over a century 's worth of patterns of usage , and non - ipa users will be equally keen to keep to their symbolizations . let 's learn to live with this , and spend instead time on refining transcription systems ( e . g . for the transcription of atypical speech found in speech pathology clinics ) . perhaps , vive la difference is the motto to aspire to ! martin j . ball university of ulster

0,"sum . : history of capitalisation in english back in late january / early february i posted a query to linguist about sources on the history of capitalisation in english . several people responded asking me to post a summary to the list on any replies i might receive . my apologies for the delay , but i have been fighting three different winter "" bugs "" ( some viral , some bacterial ) since my original posting , and then had to rush to catch up on acadaemic commitments before the end of term ! anyway , here is the summary . . . . the most immediate "" success "" reply , so to speak , came from david denison at u . of manchester , u . k . : mrcepdd @ fsl . art . man . ac . uk . david suggested the following article : osselton , noel ( 1985 ) ' spelling - book rules and the capitalization of nouns in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ' . in arn , mary - jo and hanneke wirtjes ( eds . ) . * * historical and editorial studies in medieval and modern english : for johan gerritsen . * * wolters - noordhoff , groningen , pp . 49-61 . to my delight , i found that "" my "" university library ( knight lib . at the u . of oregon ) had precisely this volume . the article ( chapter ) is only 6 pages long , but contains as well a list of spelling books and grammars , etc . to which osselton referred in the text . there is also a page of notes . this reference is the most useful i have yet seen , and i will be using it ( when i have the time ) as a foundation for finding more info . on this topic . a good place to start , i think . a reply from john e . koontz ( koontz @ bldr . nist . gov ) pointed me towards usenet lists which , i regret , i have not yet been able to try . john suggests comp . fonts , or hte repositories of past usenet postings ( he is not sure where they are ) , or the usenet faq collections . also , comp . text . larry rosenwald ( lrosenwald @ wellesley . edu ) suggested looking into the literature of printing history , as he reminded me that "" in fact capitalization was often regularized by the printer . "" henry rogers ( rogers @ epas . utoronto . ca ) wrote and remarked that "" [ t ] he distinction between upper and lower case in the roman alphabet obviously developed in the writing of the middle ages . . .

( and as a final parting shot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english writing we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environments , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a printing influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small "" i "" in roman numerals ? ) . ) from talking to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , does not have this distinction . how about other language writing systems , european or not ? and what effect does this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that "" i "" is more important than "" you , them "" etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondents . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my questions - - either post to list or to me directly . regards to all , anthea . * * "" words do n't mean , people mean . . . .

0,"latvian language policy i have found the topic of "" linguistic human rights violations "" particularly interesting , but i am a little confused as to what constitutes such a violation . marc picard writes , "" personally , i would hope that latvians would take any measures they deem necessary to get everybody in their country to speak their language . "" if someone were to issue such a statement about the language situation in the united states ( particularly with regards to native speakers of spanish who are residents / citizens of the us ) , i am sure that some group would throw up its arms in protest of the oppression of this segment of the population . is this what is meant by a "" linguistic human rights violation "" ? is it something more severe ? or are we looking at other countries and applying different standards than those which we apply in the united states ? mark mitton carleton college northfield , mn 55057 mittonm @ carleton . edu

0,"toc for linguist list dear sirs , prof . helen dry has offered that we might include announcements of our activities in linguist ( message of 24 april 97 ) . you will find the announcement of a workshop on reported speech below . thank you in advance . manfred roncador announcement of a workshop at the ' 20th conference of the german linguistic society ( dgfs ) ' in halle on ' form and function of reported speech ' coordinators : tom gueldemann and manfred von roncador linguistic studies have increasingly demonstrated that in contrast to the traditional approach a clear-cut distinction between direct and indirect speech is for many languages untenable . the existence of such intermediate forms as semi-direct speech , so-called style indirect libre ( free indirect discourse ) , and logophoric constructions point rather to an analysis whereby the different forms of reported speech are assigned a specific position on a continuum whose extreme poles are characterized by a minimal or maximal shift of the deictic centre ( cf . roncador 1988 ) . in the framework of such a theoretical approach , it is interesting to investigate which different functions the individual forms of reported speech may serve in discourse . another interesting question concerns the grammatical characteristics of quotative constructions ( qc ) , i . e . linguistic expressions used in languages to signal reported speech , and how these qcs are related to the functions of the different categories of reported speech laid out on the continuum mentioned just above . possible features to be investigated in this respect are inter alia the internal structure of qcs , the obligatoriness of the individual propositional elements in them ( such as reference to speaker and addressee ) , the particular strategy for expressing the locutionary aspect , and the nature of the semanto-syntactic relation between qc and the quote itself . the historical processes that qcs or their elements are subject to constitute another possible focus of attention . this is meant to include the discussion on grammaticalization processes in this domain , which is already quite extensive but which has probably focused too much on the development of speech verbs only . as analyses of reported speech in single languages are often still oriented towards concepts developed for european languages , contributions on non - european languages offering new insights on less-known aspects of this functional domain will be particularly welcome . this will serve to put these first attempts to typologize the phenomenon of reported speech in its functional and formal aspects ( cf . roeck 1994 ) on a broader empirical basis . references : roeck , m . de . 1994 . typology of speech reports . in : engberg - pedersen et al .

0,"re : 6 . 199 ipa it would be nice to have true democracy when trying to reach agreement on how to use phonetic symbols , as stemburger has suggested . just as war is too important a matter to be left to the generals , so choosing a standardized set of symbols should n't be left to the phoneticians . the international phonetic association has always recognized this . it is fully conscious of the fact that ipa symbols are used by a wide variety of people . at the 1989 kiel convention , which was the first major revision for almost 50 years , there was a great deal of discussion about remembering our ' customers ' , as one phonetician put it . and ( despite comments to the contrary by participants in this discussion ) the only changes since then have been small changes that affect comparatively few users of the alphabet , largely because of the belief that it is important for the alphabet to remain as stable as possible . if stemburger would like to organize some kind of referendum , good luck to him . i note that he suggests the lsa as the appropriate body for the u . s . , although he also mentions ashla ( american speech hearing and language association ) as an interested group that has officially adopted the ipa . their membership is much larger than the lsa . the asa ( acoustical society of america ) is another group that has many members interested in phonetic symbols . the1989 ipa kiel convention was open to all , and did include members of all the organizations mentioned by stemburger , including lsa , ashla , asa , sil and others , none of the participants , of course , speaking officially for any of these organizations . the convention was also publicized in a paper in language , the only paper that morris halle and i have ever co-authored . i really do not see how we can get more international collaboration . agreeing on symbols is as difficult as getting everyone to use the same units for measuring weights and distances . in response to my previous suggestion that people interested in choices of phonetic symbols should join the international phonetic association , i have received inquiries as to how to do this . there is a form in the journal of the international phonetic association ( which members receive - - and your university library + should + take ) . but really all you need to do is to send your name and address , plus a check for $ 25 or # 13 sterling ( or request to charge access / mastercharge / visa / eurocard ) for the annual dues to : secretariat , ipa linguistics and phonetics univeristy of leeds leeds , ls2 9jt , u . k . peter ladefoged

0,"affricates - - one segment or two the recent query and summary by larry trask on german affricates makes me think of the fact that , unless i am mistaken , it is perfectly easy to hear the difference between one - and two-segment stop-fricative sequences at least in some cases . polish has a contrast of this sort at least in initial position , where the words spelled _ trzy _ and _ czy _ differ only in that the former has a cluster , the second an affricate . also , if you compare the english way of saying _ ts _ with the german way of saying _ z _ ( or the polish or the yiddish , etc . ) , there is an audible difference . most english speakers ' rendition of _ matzah _ ( or _ matzoh _ ) for example sounds quite different from the yiddish or polish , but ( and this is also very suggestive ) i have found a few am . engl . speakers ( not all of them jewish , by the way ) who have the affricate , i . e . , one-segment / ts / in this and perhaps some other yiddish borrowings but the two segment / t / + / s / otherwise , so that these speakers do not rhyme _ matzah _ and _ lots o ( f ) _ , whereas most speakers do . finally , i think some speakers have a one-segment / ts / in hit ya , but a two-segment / t / + / s / in hits ya , although most speakers i have asked refuse to admit anything but the nonpalatalized , non-affricated pronunciation in the second case . alexis mr

0,"200 summary on reduplication a month before christmas ( in linguist vol-5 - 1354 ) i sent out a query about * reduplication * and how this strategy is grammaticalized in languages to convey some facet of * intensification * . this is a summary based on the 45 replies i received from linguist netters . allow me to thank you all collectively now , since i will not be referring to single respondents in the following discussion . the topic of reduplication interests me because i am writing on my phd on repetition with respect to intensification and iconicity in swedish . the point of departure in the original query were the claims found in lakoff & johnson ( metaphors we live by ; 1980 ) according to which reduplication may indicate : - plural or collective - intensification or increase - continuation or completion - diminution thus , ' more ' of physical linguistic ' form ' corresponds to ' more ' in the ' content ' of the reduplicated expression as opposed to a non-reduplicated form - - as an instance of diagrammatic iconicity ( or as a realization of the * conduit * metaphor in the terms of lakoff & johnson ) . there are reflections of the outlined principles in colloquial english in expressions like ' an old old man ' , ' the music got louder and louder ' , 's he talks talks talks ' , ' the ball bounced and bounced ' , ' there 's forms forms forms forms ' , ' it was sinking down down ' , etc . i originally mentioned , however , that these structures were * marked * in a language like english . the choice of words was perhaps not so lucky . what i meant by "" marked "" is that even if we may think that such expressions are frequent in casual speech , they are rare in more constrained contexts . a less marked way of intensifying would probably be to use a specific intensifier or quantifier , e . g . ' a very old man ' , ' talks a lot ' . i hope no one will be offended by this simplistic analysis , it is only leading us a bit beside the point . ( for a comprehensive account on "" repetition in english "" , see persson 1974 , univ . of uppsala , sw . ) i was in my query more after pointers to and examples of languages where reduplication as a means of * intensification * is an integrated , so to speak , a standard characteristic of the grammar . this was also , more or less , what i got . i will summarize the outcome in the following ; i am aware of that in most instances the "" facts "" are probably subject to qualification , but for the sake of clarity & brevity i will lay the examples ahead in a rather list-like manner . furthermore , the examples certainly represent only a sample of the languages in the world that have incorporated reduplication in their system . note that i have left out - - in order to make it all more illustrative - - possible tone marks and diacritics of the transliteration . 1 . plural or collective * in malay / bahasa ( indonesia ) , full word reduplication turns singular to plural : anak ' child ' anak-anak ' children ' * in nahuatl ( or "" aztec "" ) , prefixed reduplication with nouns conveys a plural meaning : cih-tli ' hare ' ( where ' cih - ' is the stem ) ci : cih-tli pl . - - moreover , there are no structurally distinct adjectives in nahuatl but certain "" adjectival "" suffixes that can take on a plural notion via reduplication : - pi : l diminutive suffix - pipi : l plural * hausa is cited to have reduplication in the formation of plurals of a limited set of nouns . * in japanese , reduplication may turn a noun to a collective , but the scope of this strategy is said to be marginal : hito ' person ' hitobito ' people ' kami ' god ' kamigami ' gods ' * in mandarin ( chinese ) , reduplication turns singular to collective ( but this is said to be rare ) : ren ' person ' renren ' people ' - - moreover , both in mandarin and cantonese * classifier * items may be reduplicated to convey "" universal quantification "" in contrast to more unique reference . this fits readily in the notion of intensification ( or augmentation ) : ge ren ' a person ' ( mandarin ) ge ge ren ' every person ' douh ' place , there ' ( cantonese ) douh-douh ' everywhere ' * dakotan patterns plurals of stative intransitive verbs with reduplication . this is said only to apply to instances with inanimate subjects though . north american languages in general may be of interest when considering reduplication but i am short of examples at present . following languages were mentioned in the replies , though : klamath , nez perce , sahaptin . 2 . intensification or increase * mandarin chinese intensifies adjectives with reduplication : xiao 's mall ' xiaoxiao ' very small ' gaoxing ' happy ' gaogaoxingxing ' very happy ' as you notice , with disyllabic adjectives the reduplication pattern is aabb . - - cantonese also uses reduplication for augmentation or emphasis . * turkish is , apparently , a point in case . reduplication of adjectives indicates intensification or increase in the following way : temiz ' clean ' tertemiz ' very clean ' dolu ' full ' dopdolu ' very full ' bos ' empty ' bosbos ' completely empty ' here we have prefixed reduplication accompanied with a binding consonant . interestingly , there do not seem to be "" rules "" for which binding consonant should be inserted in a given case . * hausa is cited to use reduplication in the intensification of adjectives . * celtic languages have full word reduplication to indicate intensification . the method is reminiscent of the case of english , but it may be more "" integrated "" in the grammar of the celtic ( are there any opinions about this ? ) . could the celtic model have influenced germanic languages so that we still today have rather similar reduplication in the colloquial registers ( just my own modest idea . . . ) ? here are some examples provided by netters : - - welsh : ty bach bach ' a very small house ' oglau cryf cryf ' a very strong smell ' - - gaelic : fada fada ' very long ' trua trua ' very pity ' - - breton : braz-braz ' very tall ' this is said to be common especially in negative sentences . * in colloquial russian reduplication / repetition of adj 's / adv 's has likewise an intensifying function . the use is probably stylistically similar to repetition in colloquial english , but it is said to be limited to * predicate * adjectives : belyj-belyj ' very white ' tixo-tixo ' very quietly ' * it was also pointed that finnish has prefixed reduplication in some intensified adjectival forms . this is true , indeed , but - - what it seems - - wholly lexicalized and non-productive . in any case , here are some examples i and my colleague enjoyed coming up with : taysi ' full ' ( umlaut a ) tapo-taysi ' completely full ' ( uml . a 's & o ) tyhja ' empty ' ( uml . a ) typo-tyhja ' compl . empty ' ( uml . a 's & o ) puhdas ' clean ' puti-puhdas ' compl . clean ' uusi ' new ' upo-uusi ' brand new ' pinta 's urface ' piri-pinta ' right on the surface ' suomalainen ' finnish ' supi-suomalainen ' purely finnish ' yksin ' alone ' ypo-yksin ' compl . alone ' ( uml . o ) tiessaan ' lost ' ( uml . a 's ) tipo-tiessaan ' compl . lost ' ( uml . a 's & o ) the prefixed items ' tapo ' , ' typo ' , ' tipo ' , 's upi ' , ' puti ' , ' piri ' , ' upo ' , ' ypo ' do not seem to mean anything , at least for the speakers today . it seems that the first vowel or the pair first consonant & vowel of the stem are reduplicated with a binding syllable that most often has a ' p ' and a vowel , e . g . : ta-po - taysi , ty-po - tyhja , u-po - uusi , y-po - yksin could this have been productive in some earlier stage of the language ? * finally , in classical ( only ? ) greek a small number of * verbs * may have reduplication to communicate some sort of intensifying , expressive or affective notions : pam-phain - ei ' it shines brightly ' ( ( * phan-phan - j-ei ) 3 . continuation or completion reduplication is , evidently , often used in the formation of present , progressive or perfective . i take here the view that present or progressive forms combine with * continuation * , whereas perfective forms communicate * completion * . it was nice to discover that "" classical "" linguistic tradition can offer fitting data here . it feels appropriate to begin with these examples . - - - * in sanskrit , the perfect stem is formed by reduplication : budh - ' know ' bubodh - perf . jan - ' born ' jajan - perf . aorist ( ' true perfect ' ) roots may also be formed by a kind of reduplication : jan - ajijana - ( aor . ) in addition , present stems may be formed by reduplication : bhii - 'd rink ' bibhii - pres . * classical greek uses partial reduplication , i . e . prefixation of the initial consonant of a verb plus the vowel ' e ' , in stems for perfect tenses : le-lu - k-a ' i have freed ' pe-poie : - k-a ' i have made ' ge-grap - tai ' it has been written ' if the root begins with a vowel , the vowel is augmented . furthermore , some common verbs take reduplication in their * present * tense ; the initial consonant is reduplicated with the vowel ' i ' : di-do : - mi ' i give / am giving ' gi-gno - mai ' i am becoming ' ti-the : - mi ' i am placing ' ( ( * thi-the : - mi ) * in latin , perfect forms may involve reduplication : curro ' run ' cucurri perf . - - - let us then go over to more living languages . * in hausa , reduplication applied to verbs in two different ways expresses completion or continuity respectively . modified suffixed reduplication gives an idea of * completed * action : cika ' fill ' cikakke compl . jefa ' throw ' jefaffe compl . prefixed reduplication communicates "" something like continuity "" , as expressed by the respondent : buga ' beat ' bubbuga ' keep on beating ' kira ' call ' kikkira ' call various people ' * in tagalog ( philippines ) , reduplication distinguishes * imperfective * actions from perfective : bili root of ' buy ' bibili irrealis imperfective upo root of 's it ' uupo irr . imp . kuha root of ' get ' kukuha irr . imp . some scholars call irrealis perfective * completed * aspect and irrealis imperfective * contemplated * aspect . this makes sense , since irrealis imperfective ' bibili ' seems to translate to ' will buy ' . * in wailevu / fijian ( austronesia ) , reduplication is used in so called "" object defocusing "" that involves repetition of the action and a progressive marker : au xau-ta na agone ' i carry the child ' au xau-xau jixo ' i ' m carrying now ' au dola-va na xaatuba ' i open the window ' au dola-dola jixo ' i ' m opening now ' moreover , in this language adjectives may be derived from verbs through reduplication . even if noted to be "" not productive "" , the process is fascinating : sava-ta ' wash - tr ' sava-sava - a ' clean ' the adjective could be understood to represent * completed * action , the result , in a way very similar to how the perfect participle works in , say , germanic : she has washed the cloth . - - ) a washed cloth * in nahuatl ( "" aztec "" ) , reduplication may affect the meaning of a verb in several ways . - - an action carried out in a "" systematic "" ( progressive ? ) way : tequi base for ' to slice ' or ' to hack ' te : tequi 's lice / carve something ' cho : ca ' weep ' cho : cho : ca ' weep continuously ' - - of the same base verbs , an action carried out in a "" random "" ( involving repetition ? ) way : tehtequi ' hack something up ' chohcho : ca ' to sob ' - - furthermore , reduplication may be recursive ( e . g . of ' weep continuously ' & 's ob ' respectively ) : cho : cho : cho : ca chohchohcho : ca - - verbs with certain morphologic characteristic may take on reduplication to indicate * repeated action * : tzili : ni ' make a metallic sound ' tzttzilica ' jingle ' tzitzilitza ' make something jingle ' * in afrikaans , reduplication applied to some verbs seems give a progressive idea : hy loop eet-eet ' he eats continuously while walking ' 4 . diminution there are not many examples of * diminution * in the total of replies . in a sense , the process of "" making something smaller "" could possibly go under the more general strategy of * intensification or increase * ( although it is literally about "" decrease "" ) . nevertheless , there were a couple of possibly fitting cases : * cantonese may use reduplication to convey * diminution * or * moderation * . * it was pointed that english ( ! ) has some "" diminutive "" reduplication in formations like ' itsy-bitsy ' , ' eensie - weensie ' , ' teeny-tiny ' . these carry the content ' very small ' , but they belong merely to the child-speak register . in any case , the examples are diagnostic of the diminutive case . 5 . other there are uses of reduplication that go beyond the suggested four categories above . with some restraint , some of these could perhaps be seen as slight offsprings of the more general principle of marking * plurality * . i do not go into detailed examples but mention some most common semantic categories : - - distributive reduplication : presupposes two or more referents that are taken separately ( type : ' one by one ' ) - - reflexive notions go naturally hand in hand with distributive ( type : ' one another ' ) - - the so called * delimitative aspect * , i . e . 'd oing something for a while ' , in mandarin and cantonese does not at first seem to fit in * continuity * or * completion * . however , the semantics of the delimitative aspect is said to encompass "" implied repetition "" : tai-tai ' take a look at ' ( cant . ) chang-chang ' have a taste ' ( man . ) shi-shi ' have a go ' ( man . ) what would seem logical to me is that a casual , temporally short action like ' take a look ' reaches its termination quicker than standard ' looking ' . i do n't know if this kind of an implicit sense of "" rapid completion "" could be the motivation of this reduplication ? - - - then there are numerous instances of reduplication that communicate * contrastive emphasis * . these do not necessarily combine with the above functional categories at all . the motivation of such reduplication is merely to * make a point * clearer . the ( american ) english "" double "" is a seemingly nice example of this : shall we rent a car car , or would you rather have a jeep ? of course , emphasis is a sort of * intensification * and , thus , it touches the theme of our discussion . * * * * now i think it 's time to close this rather lengthy summary . thanks for reading it . if you would like to add something to the discussion - - like comment on my suggestions - - , feel free to e-mail ( or snailmail ) the "" stuff "" directly to me .

0,"linguist nameserver the linguists nameserver - plea as many of you will know we maintain a nameserver for linguists and related scientists at linguist @ alf . let . uva . nl . this nameserver contains around 7500 e-mail addresses of persons and institutions , as well as institutional fax addresses . as with all such lists the addresses rapidly become out of date , as people change jobs , or computer centres change computers . to reduce the number of ghost adddresses , and add linguists to the list whose e-mail addresses are not presently contained in it , i would encourage all direct and indirect subscribers to linguist to check that their address ( es ) are still valid . three commands are relevant in this context : list this command enables one or more addresses to be extracted from the database . the correct syntax to extract bill clinton 's address ( just an example ) would be : list clinton this command should be sent to linguists @ alf . let . uva . nl remove this command enables a single address to be removed . the correct syntax is : remove clinton , bill : clinton @ ovalroom . whitehouse . gov add this command enables a single address to be added . the correct syntax is : add clinton , bill : clinton @ ovalroom . whitehouse . gov to change an address you require both a remove and an add operation . any combination of commands is acceptible as long each is given on a separate line . there is no restriction to one command per message . so 150 separate add commands in one message is quite acceptible . we would ask that people do not use capital letters in addresses - these are never essential . the reason for us to ask this at the present is that we will be transferring operations in the near future from the vax on which linguists is now maintained to a new unix system . this will also enable us to improve our service with new possibilities . norval smith pieter masereeuw

0,"queries in a reference i can no longer identify , i recall coming across an assertion that the accent with which east indians speak english arose as a result of the teachers of english in india during the major period of british colonialism there were from wales . as a result , indians were originally taught english with a welsh accent , a happenstance of linguistic accidnet perpetuated through succeeding generations . is ther any truth to this ? does anyone out there know the origins of this ? further - - are there any studies on characteristics of national accents in foreign tongues ( eg . is there a relationship between the characteristic accent with which italians speak english and , say , the way in which they might speak russian ; or the english person 's accent in speaking spanish or in speaking french , for instance ) . finally - - a medico-linguistic query . in older medical text - books which listening to the chest with a stethoscope , the physician is instructed to tell the patient to enunciate "" ninety-nine . "" this actually makes very little sense . the origin apparently is from an early translation from the german in which the german term-equivalent used in the original text for what was translated as "" ninety-nine "" does involve strong expirations and so is a useful tool in examination . again - - does anyone out there have any info on this ? to complicate things further - - i am a biologist and not a linguist and am not on this list ! so i would greatly apprciate it you could communicate with me directly : shodell @ aurora . liunet . edu very many thanks for reading this far and for any help you might be able to offer - - mike shodell

( 2 ) computational models and ( 3 ) symbol grounding . the target audience of this colloquium will include engineers and scientists in neural networks and artificial intelligence , developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , philosophers of mind , biologists and all of those interested in the application of artificial intelligence to real world problems . programme : monday , may 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 00 registration + sustenance 10 . 00 ` an introduction ' noel sharkey ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` the neuronal mechanisms of language ' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute for biological cybernetics , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 00 ` natural language and exploration of an information space ' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` how visual salience influences natural language descriptions ' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet des saarlandes , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 00 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 00 ` on grounding language with neural networks ' georg dorffner ( austrian institute for artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` some observations on symbol-grounding from a combined symbolic / connectionist viewpoint ' john barnden ( computing research laboratory , new mexico , usa ) & ( department of computer science , university of reading , england ) 3 . 00 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` grounding symbols in sensorimotor categories with neural networks ' stevan harnad ( department of psychology , university of southampton , england ) panel discussion and questions : 4 . 00 ` grounding representations ' chairs + invited speakers s / in s / in : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comments ' paul mc kevitt ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) 5 . 00 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : we intend to publish a book on this colloquium proceedings . addresses iee contact : sarah leong groups officer the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department of computer science regent court 211 portobello street university of sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dcs . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dcs . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration forms are available from sarah leong at the above address and should be sent to the following address : ( it is not possible to register by e - mail . ) colloquium bookings institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd herts england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although you can register on the day of the event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g i s t r a t i o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( all figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 00 non-iee members 74 . 00 iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) free non-iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) 22 . 00 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : members of the ieeie , the british computer society and the society for the study of artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour and eurel member associations will be admitted at members ' rates .

0,"sum : more discussion of human and non-human language content - length : 18462 there 's been a fair amount of discussion about language among non-humans , both publicly on linguist and privately with me , since my previous summa - ry in linguist 6-28 . i have already posted to linguist a bibliographical list , broadcast in linguist 6-195 ; here follows a summary of some of the main points that have come up in discussion . first of all , i 'd like to thank the following people who posted messages to me personally : dan alford , a . k . a . moonhawk ( dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu ) celso alvarez - caccamo ( lxalvarz @ udc . es ) rachel lagunoff ( ihw1009 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) dorothy hinshaw patent ( doropatent @ aol . com ) john e . limber ( jel @ christa . unh . edu ) alex schwartz ( alex _ schwartz @ sagepub . com ) andrew spencer ( spena @ essex . ac . uk ) mike tomasello ( tomas @ fs1 . psy . emory . edu ) bill turkel ( bill @ hivnet . ubc . ca ) george williams ( gww @ navisoft . com ) in addition to these individuals , the following people have posted items on the subject of language among nonhumans to linguist since 6-28 . i ' m going to focus less on these in the following summary , on the assumption that most of you have already read what they had to say . lloyd anderson ( ecoling @ applelink . apple . com ) sherri l . condon ( slc6859 @ usl . edu ) jane a . edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) larry gorbet ( lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) gilbert harman ( ghh @ princeton . edu ) marion kee ( marion . kee @ a . nl . cs . cmu . edu ) bob krovetz ( krovetz @ cs . umass . edu ) roger lass ( roger @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) david pesetsky ( pesetsk @ mit . edu ) benji wald ( ibeneawj @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) sherman wilcox ( wilcox @ alcor . unm . edu ) one major issue that came up in discussion was the methodological and ethical justification of evaluating the linguistic ability of non-humans by confronting them with the task of mastering a language belonging to homo sapiens , instead of by investigating the means by which they inter - act amongst themselves . in linguist , benji wald pointed out that chomsky himself , in a paper pub - lished in the sebeok / sebeok vol . mentioned in my bibliography in linguist 6-195 , carefully drew the distinction between ' human language ' , the cog - nitive system built into the * human * brain that enables us to master the various human languages that are the raw data of our studies , and ' lan - guage ' ( which i shall in this posting capitalize - - not to be confused with lsa 's journal ) , the set of all possible similar systems , in whatever species ( or machine ) they may manifest themselves . this phase of the dis - cussion began with the question of the relation between an ability to re - cognize one 's image in a mirror and an ability to handle pronouns of vari - ous sorts , including reflexives . ( briefly , dogs and cats are able to re - cognize their reflections as members of their own species but consistently treat them as ' others ' , behaving toward them as they would to strangers of their own species ; roger lass has suggested that the ability to re - cognize the reflection as 's elf ' may not be evolutionarily advantageous to such predatory animals . the anthropoid apes , however , manage after a few minutes to realize that the reflection is 's elf ' , at which point they switch from the 's ocial ' behaviours they would normally use to make the acquaintance of strangers of their own species to using the mirror as a tool for self-inspection . but there has been no evidence presented , to my knowledge or that of anyone else on the list , that chimps , gorillas , etc . have any ability to handle anaphoric reference the way human apes do . sherri condon referred us to the work of her colleague at the univer - sity of southwestern louisiana , daniel j . povinelli , on this subject . ) but ultimately this discussion came back to a fundamental issue raised in my previous summary : even were it possible , through ingenious programme design and / or arduous effort , to teach a real human language to a chimp or a gorilla , the mere fact that the system in question would have to be ' force-fed ' , as it were , is evidence in itself that there is a serious difference between the cognitive systems of the two species ( human and non-human ) in question , since humans pick the stuff up with almost no training whatsoever . since much of our research programme is dedicated , more or less directly , to investigating the ability of humans to learn individual human languages ' naturally ' ( i . e . , with a minimum of effort ) - - at least in childhood - - this unredoubted fact places the linguistic abilities of non-humans at a significant distance from our discipline 's focus area . whether the field of linguistics ought to broaden its focus area to include non-human quasi-linguistic semiotic / communicative systems is another question , of course , that was raised in private discussion with me . speaking for myself , i am very sympathetic to the notion of embedding ( to use a very professional word ) linguistics as we now under - stand it within a broader programme of research into language , including the semiotic / communicative systems of non-human animals . supposing that such animals could accomplish the task of mastering a hu - man language ( which has so far not happened ) , this would certainly prove that the difference in species is not relevant to the nature of the lan - guage in question , much less language in general . but failure to accom - plish the task is not as probative , since it can be interpreted in either of at least two ways : ( 1 ) the animals in question are no more than ' protolinguistic ' ( to use bickerton 's term ) , unable to master a system of the complexity of human language - - a quantitative evaluation . ( 2 ) the animals in question are already in possession of an equivalent system of comparable complexity but of incompatible organization ( which ipso facto interferes catastrophically with the proposed task ) - - a qua - litative evaluation . which of these alternatives is correct will require a completely diffe - rent set of experiments , carefully studying the communicative behaviours natural to these animals as we linguists study the communicative beha - viours natural to humans . one of my correspondents said , ' why is all this effort devoted towards teaching apes a modified version of english ? a complex and highly social species such as this has an extremely sophisticated natural communication system of its own , yet we know very little about this . . . surely , before embarking on experimental meddling of dubious methodological validity , it would be more prudent to construct a research program aimed at mapping out the cognitive abilities of the various species and more particularly , their home-grown communication systems . presumably , it 's only against the background of how apes communicate with each other in the wild that we will really be able to interpret the kinds of artificial experiments pio - neered by the gardners and others . . . when you provide the reference list it would be extremely interesting ( though a lot of hard work ) to compare the amount of research effort expended on teaching apes 2 - year old english , compared to the number of studies devoted to ethological study of ape communication . ' a further , related issue was the epistemological question of how to reco - gnize behaviour in another species that is equivalent to language in hu - mans . i remarked myself at one point , ' human language is not purely a communication system , and its structure is not based solely on its commu - nicative function . i use language for a variety of functions . . . it does not strike me as logically self-evident that all of these functions should be served by the same system . i can imagine a species that en - gaged in all of these behaviours but used a radically different system for each . would we be able to recognize all these different systems ? and would all of them properly fall into the field of inquiry we call ' lin - guistics ' ? larry gorbet , in his linguist posting , touched very well on a further as - pect of this problem , addressing in particular one of the criticisms that has been made of the results achieved by the gardners et al . ' any formal element whose meaning includes displacement ( or more generally , * any * fairly abstract meaning ) will be intrinsically difficult to recognize as such , simply because the "" search space "" ( for the observable behavior that points to meaning ) is so large . the result is an * intrinsic * sample bias in semantic analysis : concrete meanings are more likely to be * disco - vered * than are more abstract ones , relative to their actual frequency of occurrence . in addition to abstract meanings in the more obvious sense , meanings which concern internal states ( e . g . "" emotions "" ) can be difficult to discern if one does n't experience those states or similar ones . ' a couple of references to the science fiction literature are relevant here , science fiction being often very useful for such ' thought-experi - ments ' in the einsteinian sense . h . beam piper , who while definitely not pc was brilliant , wrote a story called ' naudsonce ' ( pp . 57-112 in the col - lection federation , published 1981 by ace . piper suicided in 1964 , and i have no idea whether ' naudsonce ' was published anywhere during his life - time ) , in which an exploration party from earth discovers an extrasolar planet inhabited by an obviously sapient species which the explorers la - bel ' svants ' . these people are living at roughly a neolithic cultural / technological level , and there 's no question that they communicate by means of deliberately modulated sound waves transmitted through the air , so the humans immediately jump to the conclusion that they have something akin to what we call ' language ' , and the professional linguist they ' ve brought along for just such eventualities gets to work trying to analyse the svants ' ' language ' and establish inter-species communication . no go . turns out that although both svants and humans communicate by means of deliberately modulated , etc . , the resemblance ends there . our auditory systems ( by which i mean both the auditory centers of our brains and the neurosensory systems in our ears that serve as their input ) are designed to convert auditory impulses into a distinct sensory experience that we call ' hearing ' . the svants ' neurosensory systems are designed to convert such impulses into something more closely approximating the sensory expe - rience that tells us about our internal states ( e . g . , feelings of hunger , thirst , satiation , heartburn , etc . ) . thus , when a human reports a feel - ing of pain or pleasure , another human apprehends the message intellectu - ally ; when a svant reports such a feeling , an equivalent feeling is di - rectly induced in the body of another svant . in order to have any hope of inter-species communication , the human explorers have to rely on two peculiar individuals : a young male svant who is as a result of a birth defect 'd eaf ' , but is otherwise quite intelligent and shows promise of being able to master an ideographic writing system , and his mother , who is ' normal ' but sticks with her son out of maternal affection , and can interpret for him to the rest of the svant community . my point in giving this rather lengthy summary is that recognition of the fundamental diffe - rence between the human and svant communicative systems constitutes a ma - jor , and very challenging , cognitive leap for the human explorers ; can we be confident that a similar cognitive leap would not be necessary for us in evaluating the cognitive behaviours of non-human apes , cetaceans , etc . ? ( piper , speaking through some of his characters , expresses scepticism that a species whose principal communication system so thoroughly bypas - ses the ' higher / rational ' cognitive centers can develop very far in the way of civilization . i personally do n't share his scepticism . several of us during discussion have considered that cetaceans use sound both as their principal means of exploring the world around them , via sonar , and apparently to communicate . this suggests that a cetacean mode of commu - nication might involve ' projecting ' a sonar ' image ' of what one is talk - ing about into the listener 's brain . such projection may involve vocali - zation skill levels outside the abilities of cetaceans ; but assuming they could do it , i do n't think such 'd irect ' communicative methods preclude a high level of civilization . i ' m not sure they ' re all that different from the ability of the chinese , or of fluent signers , to communicate highly abstract concepts by means of what is essentially visual imagery . ) those of you who have read suzette hayden elgin 's intriguing though dif - fuse novel native tongue may remember that in that novel , humans , having over the course of several decades established contact with a variety of alien species and managed to negotiate profitable trade deals with seve - ral of them in spite of the obvious language barriers ( the only reason the generally despised profession of ' linguist ' is allowed to survive in this crypto-fascist state ) , encounters a species that is obviously sapi - ent and obviously endowed with something in the way of a language ( if i remember correctly , it 's not made clear exactly how this is recognized ) , but that ' language ' is so radically different from human language in its structural organization that no human seems to be able to get the hang of it ( several people die trying ) . in both cases , we are left with the big question : what , exactly , consti - tutes language , or a ' language ' ? and how do we recognize one if it exists ? on the subject of the cognitive organization of the brains of non-human primates , steven pinker , on p . 350 of his recent book the language ins - tinct : how the mind creates language , discusses their equivalents of broca 's and wernicke 's areas : ' the neuroanatomists al galaburda and terrence deacon have discovered areas in monkey brains that correspond in location , input-output cabling , and cellular composition to the human language areas . for example , there are homologues to wernicke 's and broca 's areas and a band of fibers connecting the two , just as in humans . the regions are not involved in producing the monkeys ' calls , nor are they involved in producing their gestures . the monkey seems to use the regions corresponding to wernicke 's area and its neighbors to recognize sound sequences and to discriminate the calls of other monkeys from its own calls . the broca 's homologues are involved in control over the mus - cles of the face , mouth , tongue , and larynx , and various subregions of these homologues receive inputs from the parts of the brain dedicated to hearing , the sense of touch in the mouth , tongue , and larynx , and areas in which streams of information from all the senses converge . ' for those of you who are interested , the relevant references are : deacon , t . w . 1988 . ' evolution of human language circuits ' in h . jerison & i . jerison , eds . , intelligence and evolutionary biology . new york : springer . - - - - . 1989 . ' the neural circuitry underlying primate calls and human language ' human evolution 4 : 367-401 . galaburda , a . m . & d . n . pandya . 1982 . ' role of architectonics and con - nections in the study of primate brain evolution ' in e . armstrong & d . falk , eds . , primate brain evolution . new york : plenum . beyond this , there is the fact that the integration of even complex so - cial systems is not enough to account for the complexity of human lan - guage . a large number of human social situations seem to be manageable by just a few dozen different utterances ; yet we have a natural linguis - tic ability vastly in excess of that . i suspect that our ancestors may have developed that ability through some nonce mutation , and then over the subsequent millenia have gradually developed uses for it . ( for some at least tangentially relevant thoughts on this subject , see theodore zeldin 's recently published intimate history of humanity , harper - collins . ) before closing this posting , i will quote the following from dorothy hinshaw patent 's message to me , and reiterate my plea in linguist 6-28 for more user-friendliness in our interactions with people who are rea - sonably intelligent , may be well-educated , may even be fellow scientists , but just are n't linguists . ' i was very frustrated by the critics of the ape language work ; they seemed to be looking for reasons to say the work did n't have meaning , and i think your piece summarized many of the frustrations of people like me very well . would that everyone were able to think so clearly ! what i 'd like to see is a linguistic analysis - - using minimal linguistic jargon , so zoologists and psychologists could understand it , too - - of the work done with apes , dolphins , sea lions , and parrots , comparing the "" accom - plishments "" of the different species to one another and to human chil - dren . i 'd like the person doing it to make the assumption , as you have , that the work does have meaning , and go from there , rather than trying to find picky reasons for discounting it because of human hubris . ' let us instead adopt the attitude expressed by sherri condon : ' i think we have much to learn about cognition and communication in all species , and we are fortunate that careful researchers are on the job . ' of course , as is always true not * all * researchers ' on the job ' are ' careful ' , by which i understand ' responsible , not wedded to their hypotheses to such an ex - tent that they are unable to wrestle appropriately with contrary evidence or alternative approaches ' , but the responsible ones definitely deserve encouragement ! best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *

0,"est-ce que questions several weeks ago , i ' ve sent an inquiry about is it that / est-ce que interrogatives to the list . many of you took the time to answer to it , so i feel very sorry for not giving any summary of the replies before today . i have written one in french , which i display here . if some of you would like a translation , please ask and i ' ll write one . thanks again for your precious collaboration ! the inquiry was : j ' ai rencontre l ' enonce authentique suivant : why is it that ( people are never happy ) ? qui ressemble beaucoup au fran ais : pourquoi est-ce que ( les gens ne sont jamais contents ) ? j ' aimerais savoir s ' il est possible de poser une question de la meme maniere avec : what , who , when , where or how ? what is it that you said / are saying ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? how is it that you did / do this ? where is it that you were / are ? sur les 54 reponses obtenues , 21 consistent en une phrase : "" tous ces exemples me paraissent acceptables et normaux "" . les auteurs des autres reponses ont tres majoritairement accepte tous les exemples egalement , mais avec quelques restrictions d ' emploi que nous developpons ici . les quatre grands types de restrictions sont le registre de langue employe , la semantique de l ' interrogative , la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif et le temps du verbe etre place avant ' it that ' . 1 . le registre employe est juge pertinent pour l ' acceptabilite de la structure , comme le montrent les six remarques suivantes : "" alors que les phrases proposees seraient appropriees dans un registre tres formel , des equivalents plus courants [ colloquial ] seraient : you said / are saying whatj ? you met / are meeting whoj ? you met / are meeting her whenj ? you did / do this howj ? you were / are where j ? cet equivalent ' courant ' n ' existe pas cependant avec why . je dirais plutot : people never seem to be happy . why ( is that ) j ? "" "" why is it that convient mais ne semble pas tres naturel ; l ' emploi de ' that ' marque un registre plus formel . "" "" les exemples semblent appropries dans tous les registres , peut-etre un peu moins frequents dans un ecrit tres formel . "" "" toutes ces questions sont parfaitement ordinaires . "" "" j ' attribue ces phrases au registre courant [ colloquial ] plutot que litteraire . "" "" je dirais que ces phrases seraient acceptees par n ' importe quel locuteur americanophone , au moins dans une conversation informelle . "" les commentaires divergent , certains locuteurs attribuant les exemples a un registre formel , d ' autres a un registre non formel . la premiere personne optant pour le registre formel precise que ce type d ' enonce est caracteristique d ' une question que poserait par exemple un avocat au cours d ' un proces ; mais c ' est peut-etre plutot la semantique de la question qui importe ici , et non le registre . la deuxieme personne ayant choisi le registre formel semble cependant s ' appuyer surtout sur la presence de that . en effet , une autre reponse souligne la difference existant entre les formes ' why is it ' et ' why is it that ' . par consequent nous pouvons retenir des commentaires obtenus que la construction qui nous interesse releve globalement d ' un registre courant - voire familier - mais peut se retrouver dans d ' autres registres sous certaines formes ( avec that vs sans that ) et pour exprimer certains actes de parole . 2 . la semantique de l ' interrogative intervient elle aussi dans le choix de cette construction , comme l ' attestent les 13 remarques suivantes : "" par rapport a la construction plus traditionnelle , celle-ci se limite aux cas ou le locuteur exprime une repetition ou une clarification apres avoir pose la question sous la forme plus courante : me : what did you sayj ? you : i said "" goodbye and good riddancej ! "" me : what is it that you saidj ? i was n't listening closely . "" "" cette construction marquee n ' est appropriee que si le discours precedent a deja etabli qu ' il y aura une reponse non negative a la question . ainsi , l ' echange suivant ne semblerait pas naturel : - who is it that you sawj ? - nobody . "" "" je n ' accepterais pas ou reagirais negativement a la phrase how is it that you did thatj ? . j ' emploie cette construction avec tous les autres adverbes ( where , who , what , when ) pour obtenir un eclaircissement a propos d ' une chose deja mentionnee . "" "" les exemples me semblent normaux si le locuteur met l ' accent sur l ' adverbe interrogatif et exprime une certaine exasperation : what is that thing you boughtj ? "" "" ces questions sont tout a fait acceptables , moyennant un contexte discursif particulier du type reprise . d ' ou la meilleure acceptabilite des versions dans lesquelles le verbe est marque de l ' aspect be + ing ( fondamentalement anaphorique ) . "" "" cette construction met l ' emphase sur l ' element interrogatif . "" "" spontanement , je dirais que cette construction se focalise sur la question plus specifiquement . si l ' on me demandait : who are you meetingj ? je pourrais repondre : a friend . mais si la question etait : who is it that you ' re meetingj ? je me sentirais oblige de repondre plus precisement . "" "" la seule raison justifiant l ' emploi de cette construction est , a mon avis , l ' emphase qu ' elle met sur l ' objet de la question . "" "" en anglais , ces questions sont posees de fa on rhetorique ou pour exprimer une demande de clarification . dans le deuxieme cas , l ' element interrogatif est fortement accentue . "" "" la plupart de ces questions ressemblent a une demande de repetition de quelque chose qui aurait ete mal compris a la premiere audition . "" "" les questions de ce type correspondent a la forme declarative emphatique it is because of x that ou it is x that i am saying ( . . . ) . ces questions en anglais se traduiraient mieux en fran ais par quelque chose comme : qui c ' est que tu as vuj ? qui met aussi l ' accent sur la reponse la ou une question en est-ce que normale ne le ferait pas . cette construction entra ne aussi une accentuation plus forte sur l ' element interrogatif . "" "" dans beaucoup de cas , ces formes marqueraient une emphase utilisee par exemple si je pensais avoir mal compris un message : where is it that you [ said you ] arej ? "" "" pour moi , ces constructions presupposent que quelqu ' un vous a donne l ' information ( what , who , when ou where ) et que vous l ' avez oubliee et devez poser une question sur ce seul element . "" toutes ces remarques s ' accordent pour attribuer a la construction qui nous interesse un sens emphatique utilise pour obtenir une clarification . elle semble aussi s ' accompagner d ' une accentuation de l ' element interrogatif . il est donc interessant de remarquer que la valeur emphatique est commune aux constructions anglaise et fran aise . 3 . parmi les 54 reponses , 11 tentaient d ' expliquer partiellement ou completement la variation de l ' acceptabilite de la construction en fonction de la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif : "" where is it that you arej ? et how is it that you do thisj ? sont pour moi les constructions les plus maladroites et les moins frequentes . "" "" where is it that you arej ? est maladroit ; je repeterais probablement la question where are youj ? en accentuant plus le where . "" "" je ne pense pas que le that dans why is it that soit le meme que dans les constructions avec les adverbes interrogatifs . "" "" why is it et how is it sont toujours idiomatiques , meme s ' ils sont plutot formels . when is it est idiomatique , mais para t assez pauvre . les autres enonces identifieraient a coup sur le locuteur comme etant etranger . "" "" toutes ces constructions sont possibles , excepte celle avec how . "" "" pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . pour how c ' est different parce que how is it est une forme idiomatique signifiant pourquoi pour moi . donc how is it that you did thisj ? convient si cela signifie pourquoi as-tu fait celaj ? . si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . "" "" les constructions avec what , who et when sont acceptables , mais celles avec how et where ne semblent pas tres naturelles . "" "" toutes les constructions me conviennent ( sauf peut-etre la derniere avec where , qui me para t bizarre ) . "" "" je pense qu ' il ne serait pas approprie d ' employer is it that dans aucune des situations mentionnees , excepte why is it that . . "" "" j ' utiliserais cette construction avec when seulement s ' il etait suivi de was it ; je ne l ' emploierais pas avec how et where . "" "" tous les exemples cites sont acceptables mais , mise a part la question avec why ( et peut-etre celle avec how ) , ils ne semblent pas aussi generaux que la question ordinaire [ unmarked ] . "" pour des raisons qui leur sont probablement propres , why , how et where se distinguent des autres adverbes . how is it peut s ' interpreter a la fois comme une forme figee qui a le sens de pourquoi ( = how come ) , et comme une construction non figee signifiant comment . . cela explique les differences de perception de cette forme par les locuteurs , qui n ' ont pas toujours pris en compte ses deux sens . why is it a egalement un comportement de forme figee , mais qui garde le sens de pourquoi . pourquoi est aussi un adverbe qui se demarque des autres en fran ais , car la question qu ' il pose porte sur l ' ensemble de la phrase ( pourquoi tu t ' en vasj ? mais * tu t ' en vas pourquoij ? ) . nous expliquons moins facilement la specificite de where qui a ete relevee a 5 reprises . 4 . le dernier facteur d ' acceptabilite egalement souvent cite ( huit fois ) par les natifs est le temps du verbe etre place avant it that . : "" toutes ces phrases s ' emploient couramment en anglais . a noter qu ' on peut aussi bien utiliser ce genre de structure au passe : where was it that you ran into him yesterdayj ? "" "" nous formons souvent des enonces come ceux que vous citez , par exemple : who was it who split ink on your book ? why was it that he was late ? who did we say was coming at 8 o ' clock ? etc . "" "" pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . [ pour ] how is it that you did thisj ? , et si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . "" "" toutes les phrases me conviennent , meme si dans plusieurs cas j ' ai pense qu ' il y avait une meilleure alternative : what is it that you said / are saying ? ) aussi : what was it that you said ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? ) aussi : who was it that you met ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? ) avec "" met "" , "" when was it that you met "" est meilleur . how is it that you did / do this ? ) aussi : how was it that you did that ? where is it that you were / are ? ) avec "" were "" , "" where was it that you were "" est meilleur . "" "" toutes les phrases sont bonnes . elles seraient un peu meilleures si les temps des verbes s ' accordaient . "" "" les questions conviennent toutes , tant que le temps employe est correct . "" "" quand l ' anglais emploie l ' expression is it that , les temps des verbes doivent correspondre dans la plupart des cas . "" "" toutes les phrases sont parfaitement correctes , sauf que normalement j ' accorderais le temps du premier verbe a celui du second lorsque deuxieme la portion de la phrase est au passe . par exemple : who was it that you met ? ( but ) who is it that you are meeting ? when was it that you met her ? ( but ) when is it that you are meeting her ? . "" nous pouvons sur ce point differencier les constructions ' is it that ' et ' est-ce que ' , la construction de l ' anglais etant beaucoup moins figee que celle du fran ais . en effet , le fran ais n ' accorderait pas les temps des deux verbes .

0,"referencing example numbers in wp since the question has been raised about how to reference example numbers in wordperfect for dos , here 's my two-cents ' worth about wp5 . 1 and wp6 for dos . in 5 . 1 , although one could use paragraph numbers , as was suggested , this precludes using them to number sections of a paper . a better approach is to use the numbering facilities for "" graphics boxes . "" like paragraph numbers , graphics boxes can be referenced by the cross-reference feature in wp . what you have to do is set equation box options so that the caption is to the left of the box ( the default is to the right ) . for phonological rules , which can be nicely formatted using the equation editor , you then create an equation box with a caption consisting of "" ( [ box number ] ) "" and go into the equation editor to write the rule . for sample sentences , etc . , the box itself is empty , but with a caption as before , and set to allow text to overlap it . you can then exit the create graphics box screen and proceed to type the examples . the numbers automatically update as new boxes are added . cross - referencing is done by assigning name to any example you want to reference ( as a cross-reference target ) and then putting in a cross-reference reference code with the target 's name . you have to generate occasionally to update the reference numbers ; they initially appear as ? . in wp6 ( which is superior for linguistics because of its support for phonetic symbols ) it 's even easier . wp6 has a counters feature ( in the character format dialog box ) . you define a counter ( i call mine example ) . whenever you want to insert an example , you type ( in the main document screen ) the open parenthesis , go into the counters dialog box , and push f8 ( or click on the increment and display button ) . this inserts two codes : one to increment the number ( this is not done automatically for user-defined counters ) and one to display it . cross - referencing is done as before . a couple of additional wp tips : - the styles feature is very useful for dealing with in-text stylesheets for journals . for any feature where journals have different styles ( scare quotes , sentence glosses and translations , in-text reference punctuation , etc . ) you assign a style . styles can be any combination of characters and codes . for each journal , you create a different style library . then , if you want to change formatting from one to another , you simply read in a different style library . - the above is too simple for bibliography style sheets , where the order of elements differs in addition to punctuation and font attribute . if you are comfortable with programming , you can write merge programs ( called primary merge files in wp5 . 1 and merge form files in wp6 ) for the different stylesheets and have a bibliography file which is formatted as a secondary merge file ( wp5 . 1 ) / merge data file ( wp6 ) , with fields for things like author 's first and last names , year , title , etc . ( include a field for type of reference ( book , article , dissertation , etc . ) since the format of the title may vary . ) this is not recommended for computerphobes , however . - lining up foreign language examples with word-for - word glosses in proportional fonts can be done using tabs , and resetting the tab stops for each example . this is easier from wp6 . 0b onwards ( if you have a mouse ) because of the ruler feature : you display the ruler and drag the tab stops , and as you drag them a dotted line extends down from the tab stop through the text so you can see exactly where you are . in previous versions , you have to go into the tab set menu and play with the tab settings by trial and error . it is even possible to put asterisks inside the space of the tab between the example number and the example . instead of tabbing , use the tab align ( wp5 . 1 ) or decimal align ( wp6 ) feature ( ctrl f6 ) . before pressing ctrl - f6 , set the "" decimal character "" to the first letter of the example ( on the other format menu in 5 . 1 and the character format menu in 6 ) . to prevent the spell-checker from stopping on words in foreign examples ( or phonetic representations , or logical formulae ) , in 5 . 1 you can use the language feature to insert a made-up language code . the spell-checker will complain that it can't find the dictionary for the language , and you tell it to ignore the language and continue checking what it can . in wp6 a block can be marked [ speller / grammatik off ] ( on the other format menu ) to prevent it from being spell - or grammar-checked . - - yehuda n . falk department of english the hebrew university of jerusalem "" live long and prosper "" - vulcan greeting

1,"we know you needed this , so . . . . greetings , this email is about fighting spam , and winning . > > please forward to your friends , family and co-workers to people that want to get spam out of their email : read this , you ' ll like what i am doing . . . . : ) to people that want to flame me for whatever reason : do n't be an egomaniac , i have a right to free speech , and the right to say it to a lot of people , so buzz off . - - - - - first let me tell you who i am and what i do . my name is robert young , i live in moscow , idaho , u . s . a . , and i have been using the internet since 1990 . i have watched the internet go from a small community of serious professionals to a roaring civilization of over 100 million people . until 8 months ago i had been a private investigator specializing in the apprehension of criminal fugitives . after 8 years of doing that i started getting burned out and decided to turn my life long hobby of programming computers into a full time job . now i write specialized applications for investigating and locating information on the internet . this summer , during the last week of july , i finally got fed up with the fact that i could not seem to get my 5 year old email address off of spam lists . i would reply to their emails with the word "" remove "" like most of them say and the next day i would get more . i sent my email address to remove lists , complained to administrators , postmasters , and my friends . none of it seemed to make a bit of difference . i decided to investigate the bulk email business . what i found made me so angry i almost blew a fuse . did you know : 1 . spammers steal valid email addresses and use them for return addresses . you could get the blame ! 2 . spammers purposely deceive filters designed to protect your email address . 3 . spammers "" hijack "" mail servers that are meant to relay messages from computer to computer . when they overload these servers , your legitimate email can be lost ! 4 . congress is not going to pass any laws in the united states anytime in the near future to stop this garbage , and they may never do so . some members of congress have actually campaigned through email . ( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that 's a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n't take government intervention , we all know that our government could n't feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous "" anti-spammers "" only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n't want it to end because then they would n't have a crusade anymore . think i ' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n't there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n't easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n't sure ) family member ' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good .

1,"hello explode your buisiness . . . right now ! this is the break you have been waiting for you do n't want to trash this one warning : this is real ! ! pass this up lightly and you ' ll be making one of the most grave mistakes of your life read this twice ! ! ! ! ! please accept my apology if this was sent to you in error ! you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 - in less than 90 days read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! . . . hi , my name is jessy lemieux , and i am the one who sent you this e-mail ( if not , someone i sent this to decided to leave my statement ) . first , let me assure you that this is real . i am a senior in high school in victorville , ca ; just an average person just as you probably are , but am already beginning to become wealthy beyond what i have ever dreamed . i can understand if you dont believe me right now , but i urge you to take a little time to read this and maybe think about it for a few days . that s what i did . i recieved this same e-mail about two months ago . i was skeptical , but after some consideration i decided to go for it . i decided that the $ 20 needed to start was worth risking ( besides if it was a scam i was going to go to the police with the addresses below and get the guy running it busted so that he couldn t rip off anyone else ) . well , to my surprise , i received my reports ( you ll find out about those later ) within two weeks via e-mail . soon i got a po box and a list of two million e-mails ( all very easy ) and started sending emails through a bulk email program i downloaded . everything was easy after that , and the cash was rolling in . and thats my story ( i have no reason to lie to you , my address is below and the last thing i want is hate mail for the rest of my life ) . if you are still concerned , write me and i will answer any questions you have . this truly is the opportunity of a lifetime , don t let it pass you by . sincerely , jessy lemieux pres . w . o . w . incorporated dear friend , the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends , and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . i truly believe it was wrong for me to be in debt like this . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share my experience in hopes that this will change your life forever . . . . financially ! ! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i 'd make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of ' 96 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not "" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does notrequire you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at m . o . c . marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number you must include your e-mail address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : w . o . w . incorporated po box 2527 victorville , ca 92393 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : m - tronics 32445 regents blvd . union city , ca 94587-4849 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from rkl international 3060 w . country meadow dr . tucson , az 85742 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : thunder tech . 202 lathrop st . south hadley , ma 01075 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this is the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that costs me pennies to produce and email . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or pyramid scam . at times you have probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain letters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four 4 financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced ; emailed to the requester . best wishes with the program and good luck ! "" it was truly amazing "" "" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this program . but conservative as i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no way that i could not get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i ever surprised when i found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders ! i will make more money this year than any ten years of my life before . "" mary riceland , lansing , mi tips for success send for your four 4 reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in . when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the product / service to comply with us postal and lottery laws . title 18 sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that : "" a product or service must be exchanged for money received .

0,"whatever happened to 'd ? dear subscribers , recently i came across an example of better used without had in the following construction : she better stop . as it was an american publication , i assumed that the use of had in such expressions had completely disappeared , in written as well as spoken us english . i would not have been surprised to find that it had disappeared from spoken usage , since there are obvious phonological reasons , but the loss of it in writing indicated to me that the use of better alone was quite standardised . this poses a question for me , and i was wondering if anyone out there has a suggestion . if it is now standardised , and there is no longer a had , why does n't the former bare infinitive stop now become finite and take 3ps inflection ( ? she better stops ) ? is this because it now has assumed a subjunctive-like quality ? can it then be associated with the expression : it is better that she stop ? if so , can another adjective be substituted for better here , e . g . it is good that she stop ) ? ? she good stop ? how has this been reanalysed , and what are the implications ? ( susan dopke informs me that some grammarians have interpreted better in these contexts as an auxiliary , and if that is the case , can we use sub-aux inversion to make it a question ? ( ? better she stop ? ) is this now acceptable too ? please send your suggestions if this bothers you . debbie ziegeler

0,"summary : "" grasshopper mind "" short answer : "" grasshopper mind "" is british english , not japanese - english . summary answer : thanks to those linguist readers who responded to my query ( 5 . 1431 , 94 / 12 / 11 ) about "" grasshopper mind , "" an expression that is entered into kenkyusha 's japanese - english and english - japanese dictionaries ( 1974 , 1980 ) and roget 's thesaurus ( 1982 ) , but apparently not found in any monolingual english dictionaries . the respondents , in alphabetical order , were : deborah milam berkley , marie egan , ted harding , steven schaufele , steve seegmiller , todd sieling , and stephen p . spackman . the inquiry asked four questions : ) do other english language reference works enter "" the grasshopper mind "" ? ) is it a varietal or dialectal term ? when was it first recorded ? are ) there analogous "" grasshoppery "" words in other languages ? ( 1 ) looking up "" grasshopper mind "" in english dictionaries is a lexicographical dead end . i ' ve checked dozens - - including old and new , standard and slang , uk and us , - - and not one enters it . some larger dictionaries record a derogatory sense of _ grasshopper _ ; e . g . , the new shorter oxford english dictionary ( 1993 ) : "" 2 . _ fig . _ a person held to resemble a grasshopper in character or behaviour ; an inconstant , flighty , or frivolous person . l16 . "" and the near-synonym "" grasshopper brain "" is webster 's third new international dictionary ( 1971 ) usage example for _ grasshopper _ meaning 3 . 2 "" light and frivolous : untouched by care for the future . "" ( 2 ) harding definitively answers the second question : ) "" grasshopper mind "" is well-known standard uk english usage . to say ) someone "" has a grasshopper mind "" means that their focus of attention ) jumps unpredictably from subject to random subject . none of the other respondents , including three widely-dispersed speakers of american english ( berkley , egan , seegmiller ) , had seen or heard this collocation , but all agreed they could readily understand what it means . in terms of _ grasshopper _ meaning ' frivolous , careless , ' the semantics of "" grasshopper mind "" are fairly self-explanatory .

but there are no real outlets for the plain presentation and discussion of * data * . this meeting will consist of two elements : a . a collection of data , printed as an issue in the society 's occasional series , _ the yuen ren society treasury of chinese dialect data _ , and b . a presentation of the data by the fieldworker or compiler , together with discussion by the audience . the _ treasury _ will be available at the meeting , where it will serve as the handout . ii . deadlines . 28 january 1995 , for submission of an abstract and either a full-length draft of the material or a reasonably long sample from it . 28 february 1995 , for receipt by the society of the final camera-ready draft . this deadline is firm ; if you are afraid you are going to miss it , you should be in touch with the society * before * that happens . there is no deadline for registration at the conference , but we would like to know beforehand if you plan to attend . iii . submission of material . anyone wishing to present data at the society 's conference must submit it for publication in the _ yuen ren treasury of chinese dialect data _ . all submissions will be subject to review . if you cannot be present at the conference , you may still submit material to the current issue of the _ treasury _ . this conference is independent of the american oriental society meeting . there is no fee for the yuen ren society meeting , but it is the responsibility of everyone who attends to pay any aos registration fees that may be required of them . iv . attendance by non-participants . the conference is open to everyone , including people who are not members of the yuen ren society . there will be no fee for attending the conference , but there may be a small on-site registration fee for anyone who wants a copy of the _ yuen ren treasury _ . the _ treasury _ will serve as the combined handout for the whole conference . v . notes on style and format . 1 . the society favors the use of gwoyeu romatzyh , but will not reject any other reasonable system of romanization , as long as all tonal distinctions are represented in some consistent way . papers that use romanization without some form of tonal distinction will be rejected . both traditional and simplified characters are welcome . 2 . the languages of the conference and of all papers should be english or mandarin . 3 . length of individual presentations at the conference will be variable , with up to 25 minutes per presentation , and discussion ad hoc . please tell the society how long your presentation will be . length of documents in the _ treasury _ will also be variable , depending on their contents . 4 . all papers should include a section in the bibliography entitled "" sources of dialect data "" or something comparable , in addition to the ordinary list of works cited . papers introducing data from original fieldwork * must * list the names of all sites represented , together with information about the informants used and the dates of fieldwork . papers using any data not gathered by the author personally * must * list the sources of each distinct set of data . it is a good idea to distinguish different sources , even if they represent the same site . 5 . all submissions to the _ yuen ren treasury _ must be made in camera-ready hard copy . handwritten documents , unless they are remarkably neat , will ordinarily be rejected . for documents produced on a computer , common serif fonts such as courier or new york should be used for roman letter writing apart from ipa , and a sharply legible bitmap or outline font such as sung should be used for kanji . very neatly handwritten kanji are acceptable . if in doubt , send a sample of your typefaces to the society * before * the submission deadline . 6 . finished documents should have margins a minimum of one inch wide . print should be black only , and the body of the text should be between 12 and 14 point in size and double spaced . documents produced on a computer should be printed at not less than 300 dpi . 7 . in general , papers should follow the style guidelines of a recent edition of the _ chicago manual of style _ . vi . restrictions : barring exceptional circumstances , the following will be considered outside the scope of the conference , since there are already other outlets for them : 1 . papers emphasizing formal analysis or formal representation . 2 . new romanization schemes . 3 . papers comparing a single modern dialect to the jin ' in ( a . k . a . _ chiehyunn _ ) phonological system . 4 . papers all of whose data is culled from published sources , unless the source is rare or for some reason poorly known . 5 . studies of "" mandarin "" , "" taiwanese "" , "" cantonese "" , "" hakka "" , or other standard dialects , based neither on fieldwork nor the speech of named sites or sources . 6 . presentations that do not consist primarily of data .

0,"discontinuous constituency i am currently reviewing literature on the subject of discontinuous constituency and would like to get my hands on work that : 1 ) discusses some of the larger theoretical issues at stake , and / or 2 ) uses the notion of discontinuous constituency to describe languages other than english ( e . g . , amy dahlstrom 's article on discontinuous constituents in fox ) . if anyone could point me towards some references , i would be greatly appreciative . sincerely , stuart robinson reed college

0,"canadian english hello , i would like to give my students at mcgill an assignment concerning geographical ( and social ) variation in canadian english . to do so , i should therefore build a short questionaire that will allow them to elicit words and pronuncations which are likely to vary depending on the social characteristics of their consultants . i would very much appreciate if my fellow linguists could provide me with good test items for that questionaire . thanks in advance . - - julie auger

0,"re : 6 . 775 , syldavian tutorial there is one ( at least ) translation of the oldest syldavian text , which our first tutorial ommitted . ihave waited to long to refer interested readers to my sources , but it is an inevitable work for those interested as much in syldavian as in bordurian . it comes from frederic soumois ' dossier tintin : sources , versions , themes , structures , jacques antoine , 1987 . it shows how much herge used brussels french and flemish roots in every language he "" devised "" in his works . for example , pace guy who adopted herge 's own suggestion of translation of "" eih bennek , eih blavek "" by "" qui s ' y frotte s ' y pique "" ( roughly , "" whoever rubs himself against it will get stung by it "" ) , it looks more like dutch "" hier ben ik , hier blijf ik "" , meaning "" here i am , here i stay "" . the translation soumois proposes for the xivth century manuscript goes approximately like this ( i won't bother to go into the etymological details , and i won [ t try to reproduce the original text : "" father ottokar , thou art then king of [ the city / poland ? ] , then the trone is for me "" . that one says to the other : "" come get the sceptre "" . and the king stroke staszrvich with the sceptre , and the nanny-goat [ ? ] fell on the floor / was left on the field . "" i also recommend , as an example of l2 morphology , the excellent passage in borduria that one can find in the french version of "" the calculus affair "" ( l ' affaire tournesol ) , unfortunately absent in the english version , and hopefully to be found again in the german version , if i can get it ( and probably not in the chinese version ) . there are also short passages of linguistic interest in destination moon and explorers on the moon , and , for arumbaya , in tintin and the broken ear . any useful or absolutely useless information welcome . richard desrochers

0,"obligatory affixes : summary several weeks ago i asked how the traditional notion of obligatory affixes was recast in the theory of realizational morphology . the responce was not exactly overwhelming , but i wish to thank greg stump ( eng101 @ ukcc . uky . edu ) , don ringe ( dringe @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu ) , r . beard ( rbeard @ coral . bucknell . edu ) , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy ( a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz ) for helpful responses . a few responses ( slightly edited ) : greg stump : in paradigm function theory , a language 's inventory of morphosyntactic features is assumed to determine - - for any major syntactic category x - - a paradigm schema : a set of cells each of which is associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to category x . in latin , for example , the features of case ( i . e . nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , ablative ) , number ( singular , plural ) , and gender ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) determine a paradigm schema for adjectives which consists of thirty cells , one for each of the case / number / gender combinations for which adjectives may be inflected . an adjective 's paradigm is then viewed as the inventory of inflected forms assigned to these cells . for any given cell c in the adjectival paradigm schema , there is a corresponding paradigm function which applies to an adjectival lexeme l to yield the inflected form of l assigned to c . paradigm functions are defined in terms of more specific morphological rules , including rules of exponence and rules of referral ; two or more of these may come into competition in the evaluation of a given paradigm function , in which case the narrower rule overrides the more general . how , then , is the notion of obligatory affixes recast in this theory ? notice first that the architecture of the theory guarantees that every inflected word w of category x will be associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to x , and that it is this set of specifications that drives the inflection of w . in other words , it is the morphology , not ( pace anderson ) the syntax , that ` ensures that any given word has all the features required by the affixes in question ' . ( naturally , i assume that a lexeme 's invariant feature specifications - - e . g . a noun 's gender - - are simply supplied by its lexical entry . ) second , if a particular affix position must be filled , then that position can be assumed to be associated with a set of rules of affixal exponence the least narrow of which functions as the default for that position . [ i have some questions about how that works where the choice of one affix seems to require the presence of morphosyntactic features which are otherwise absent , but it may be that all such examples could be reanalyzed . it would be unfair of me to say more until i ' ve had a chance to correspond with greg . - - mm ] [ some references : ] ` a paradigm-based theory of morphosemantic mismatches ' , _ language _ 67 ( 1991 ) , 675-725 . ` on the theoretical status of position class restrictions on inflectional affixes ' , in _ yearbook of morphology 1991 _ , ed . by geert booij and jaap van marle , 211-241 .

0," syntax marcus maia . the comprehension of object anaphora in brazilian portuguese . usc . 1994 . distributed by gsil publications , usc . this thesis examines the comprehension of the empty category and the third person lexical pronoun in object position in brazilian portuguese ( bp ) . experimental results show that the processing of bp overt and nonovert objects is consistent with the leading idea underlying the overt pronoun constraint ( opc ) proposed by montalbetti ( 84 ) . experiment 1 compares the processing of overt pronouns and empty categories in object position in bp in structures in which these anaphors are a - bound by a subject and in structures in which they are a - bar-bound by a topic . results from 48 bp speakers indicate reactivation of the antecedents only by topic-bound gaps and by subject-bound overt pronouns in experiment 2 , the difference between the coreferential vs . bound readings in bp is further investigated by comparing the possibility of the strict and sloppy readings for the overt pronoun and the gap in object position . based on these experimental results , we argue for the classification of the bp null object as an instance of a null epithet , an empty r - expression with pronominal properties . the experiments are also informative with relation to several theoretical psycholinguistic issues . for more information , please contact gsil publications gsil @ scf . usc . edu south asian langs pan-asiatic linguistics : proceedings of the third international symposium on language and linguistics . chulalongkorn university , bangkok , thailand . 8-10 january 1992 . 1482 pp .

0,"workshop announcement articulatory databases workshop on articulatory databases munich thursday 25th and friday 26th may , 1995 we are currently starting the preparations for a two-day workshop on articulatory databases . this will be the third in the series of workshops organized by the accor working group ( a consortium of phonetic institutes financed by the european community 's esprit programme ) and and follows the electromagnetic articulography meeting in munich ( april , 1992 ) , and the tongue modelling meeting in barcelona ( december 1993 ) . a few words on the aims of a meeting devoted to such an apparently dry topic : the basic premise is that the free availability of articulatory data could provide benefits in several partly overlapping areas : in basic research it could allow investigators to test hypotheses formulated in articulatory terms on a much wider range of data than the individual worker would normally be able to acquire or access unaided . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for deriving articulatory representations from acoustic data - relevant both for basic understanding of speech production as well as in potential applications such as speech displays for training the speech impaired . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for speech synthesis / recognition using an articulatory level of representation . the aim of the workshop would be to generate an exchange of ideas among people active in these areas in order to identify , for example ( further suggestions welcome ) : 1 ) what articulatory data is in existence that it would be beneficial to make more freely available ( archival / retrospective approach ) ? 2 ) what standards should freely available data meet ? - specification of recording conditions - anatomical frames of reference - levels of accuracy / reliability - linguistic specification of the speech samples - preferred data structures for distribution . - any other issues relevant to the data being used without risk of misinterpretation by people not actually involved in the the details of acquisition articulatory data can come in many guises depending on the speech subsystem tapped into and the transduction technique used . thus , it is possible to monitor position ( 1 , 2 or 3 dimensions ) , force , emg , airpressure / flow with techniques that may be static or dynamic , may involve imaging or point-tracking etc . etc . we think that people directly involved in acquisition can also benefit from considering how techniques can be standardized to promote maximum comparability of recordings made at different sites and with different hardware . 3 ) in analogy to acoustic databases ( where unlabelled data is of only the most limited use ) , what segmentation and labelling information ( and tools for the exploitation thereof ) could / should be made available with the raw data to facilitate flexible access for different purposes ? 4 ) for future recordings , what categories of data and corpora would be potentially of most widespread use ? if you are interested in participating please contact phil hoole ( preferably by email ) at the address below as soon as possible . further information on registration and format for presentations will be distributed early in 1995 . please also draw this letter to the attention of any colleagues you think might be interested . phil hoole and hans tillmann institut fuer phonetik munich university schellingstr . 3 d - 80799 munich germany fax : + 49 89 2800362 email : hoole @ sun1 . phonetik . uni-muenchen . de

0,"possessives i ' ve been away for awhile , but i just came back and checked my email , finding benji wald 's speculative comments on _ of 's _ constructions , dated may 20th , the linguist list . i just want to say one thing : way to go , benji ! ! i think it 's great that my question and summary can have led to such great and interesting ruminating on an admittedly poorly-understood area of the english language . as i wrote to another interested party , i hope that this whole thing has opened up a great big can of worms , the messier the better . i ' m just vindictive enough to love seeing formalist theories smashed to smithereens by real language data , and just crazy enough to love the chaos . i 'd love to see more comments put out on the list by anyone with even a passing interest in the matter and a few baffling examples they can't explain . just to further the matter a little , i 'd like to comment on something in benji wald 's article ? ( installment ? memo ? hmmm . . . . what do we call serial email things like this ? ) he wrote : > a friend of john 's ( inhale ) wife = ? ? one of john 's friends ' wife > > / and i ' m starting to dislike the last example on the right . / > > i do n't think position of inhale really helps , well , maybe if you > know whether i ' m asthmatic or not ( is that how you spell it in > english ? ) > also note in passing that another irregular plural can take a bow for > doing something useful , > > one of john 's wife 's friends vs . one of john 's wives ' ( ? ? es ) friends > > cntr . one of john 's significant other 's ( / others ' ( ? ? es ' ) friends > > ( and once again : yeah , but if you say it . . . ) > > but then again , what 's the difference between : > one of john 's friends ' ( . . . ) wife and one of john 's friends ' > wives > ( i mean given current anglophonic customs ) , except that we can > formally reduce the latter to > one of the wives > but not the former to > one of the wife > / that 's why i do n't like "" one of john 's friends ' wife "" / i think i understand why he does n't like _ one of john 's friends ' wife _ - - it 's because it sounds funny if we have the abbreviated phonological form [ . . . djanz frenz wayf ] . but , if we add in another / z / to "" friends ' "" , it seems to sound better ( even more so with modification ) : 1 ) one of john 's long-time friends 's [ frenz . z ] wife is evil . however , 2 ) the wife of one of john 's ( long-time ) friends 's is evil . sounds better than either to me . but here 's something for the experts . in sentence ( 2 ) above , i feel an almost irresistable urge to steal the final / z / from "" friends 's "" and put it on "" john 's "" , which would leave the sentence : 2 ' ) the wife of one of john 's 's [ djanz . z ] long-time friends is evil . which , funny as it looks in print , is the most grammatical-sounding sentence so far , as far as i ' m concerned . in ( 2 ' ) , the wife has to be the friend 's , of course , and not john 's , so why is "" john "" able to get the / z / ? signed , another ( happily ) flustered linguist .

0,"sum : function words i . the question and its motivation three weeks ago or so , i asked linguist readers to help me find examples of function words with unusually specific meanings . this was meant to elicit examples that i could mention in a paper called "" the formal semantics of grammaticalization "" , where i discuss what happens to the meaning of a content morpheme that develops into a function morpheme . i argue there , developing work by other semanticists / logicians , that ( 1 ) function morphemes do have meanings ( contrary to a widespread assumption ) . just consider that the meanings of quantifiers , tense , aspect , modals , etc . are the bread and butter of us working semanticists . ( 2 ) there is a class of "" logical "" meanings that have certain formal properties ( permutation-invariance , high types ) . ( 3 ) unfortunately , there is no perfect correlation between logical meanings and functional morphemes . there are lexical / content morphemes with ( almost ) logical meanings ( adjectives "" same "" , "" mere "" , "" alleged "" , verbs "" deny "" , "" believe "" , nouns "" majority "" , etc . ) . and there might be functional morphemes with non-logical meanings ( hence the linguist query ) . ( 4 ) thus there is not much that we can say about what happens to the meaning of a morpheme that is becoming grammaticalized . although i make some presumably doomed efforts . the finished paper ( which is based on a talk i gave at the nels 25 workshop on language change ) will appear in the nels 25 proceedings ( to be available from the glsa at umass amherst , glsa @ linguist . umass . edu ) . the paper is downloadable by anonymous ftp from the following url : ftp : / / broca . mit . edu / pub / fintel / gramma . ps i would welcome any comments . ii . some of the responses : mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) wrote : ) the reference [ to the pejorative pronouns "" you shit "" ] ) is samuel elbert 's grammar of ) rennellese / bellona , "" echo of a culture : a grammar ) of rennell and bellona "" , uhawaii press 1988 ) [ oceanic linguistics special publication no . 22 ] . ) ) a few interesting cases of ) grammaticalization of a somewhat relevant ) type do exist . in micronesian languages ) there are a set of verbal affixes for ) directionality ( up , down , towards speaker , ) towards hearer , towards some third ) party [ the usual deixis system ] ) which ) also include "" toward the open ocean "" ) and "" toward the lagoon "" ; whereas ( of course ) ) if you want to say "" toward john 's house "" ) ( or some other nonce collocation ) ) you need to use a pp . ) ) similar , but probably not similar enough , ) is the bizarre use of the cardinal directionals ) in icelandic documented in a classic paper ) by einar haugen ( i can dig up the reference ) if you really want it ) . it seems like , being ) predominantly coastal inhabitants , and having ) a rather uneven fjorded coastline , to go ) to a city which was north of you actually ) involved heading out in a southerly ) direction ( all that time ) .

0,"t thanks to everyone who responded to my questions about latex fonts and using linux in general . respondents were : jen hay ( jennifer . hay @ vuw . ac . nz ) mark hale ( hale1 @ husc . harvard . edu ) greg iverson ( iverson @ csd . uwm . edu ) "" james a . mcgilvray "" ( jim @ dep . philo . mcgill . ca ) michael covington ( mcovingt @ ai . uga . edu ) james magnuson ( magnuson @ hip . atr . co . jp ) uli sauerland ( sauerlan @ mit . edu ) tom green ( tmgreen @ mit . edu ) "" larry trask "" ( larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) ted . harding @ nessie . mcc . ac . uk ( ted harding ) "" c . a . creider "" ( creider @ julian . uwo . ca ) mark liberman ( myl @ sansom . ling . upenn . edu ) first of all , the responses clearly indicate that there exists at least two ipa fonts for latex ( see below ) . responses to my more general questions ranged from enthusiastic encouragement about using latex and linux , to fervernt wishes that i rethink my abandonment of the macintosh os , to recommendations of other operating systems and / or text-processing or dsp systems . i should perhaps have mentioned that i am already relatively familiar with bsd unix , so switching to linux will not be much of a shock in and of itself - though obviously using latex will be quite a change from a mac - based word processor . . . the score is currently : pro latex w / ipa : 7 pro linux : 4 pro mac : 1 pro nextstep : 1 anti latex : 1 and a number of somewhat mixed responses , suggesting for the most part that i remain with a mac for text processing , but work with some kind of unix environment for dsp and data processing , or that i stick with a mac for the actual sound manipulation but switch to linux for everything else . re : dsp there were at least two recommendations for signalyze for the macintosh , and two for ogi-tools for unix systems . some select quotes ( anonymously to discourage os partisanship from seeping into real life ) : "" i thoroughly recommend switching to latex . "" "" i ' m running a linux box and use latex for all professional word - processing these days . . . i have n't found anything i can't do yet . "" "" i ' ll say this for linux , compared to dos , windows , os / 2 , desqview , and windows nt ( latest versions of all ) , i ' ve been running linux for a year and a half and it has never once crashed . never . every one of those others has . "" "" gee , i hope switching from a macintosh to a linux workstation is n't too painful . . . do you really have to do this ( power macintosh machines are indeed powerful , and the word processing situation is well developed with wordperfect 3 . 1 , nisus writer 4 . 06 , others ) . "" "" while on the topic of unix instantiations of tex , you might look at nextstep instead of linux . . . next 's gui is , honestly , elegant . "" "" there are several good ipa font sets for latex , as well as a whole bunch of accents available even if you do n't use special fonts . "" "" i use latex ( both on linux and on other unixes ) for all my papers and there are a couple good packages of phonetic symbol fonts that work great with latex . "" "" first of all , i dislike latex intensely , as do most of my colleagues in linguistics . we find it uniquely user-hostile : basically , you can't change any defaults unless you have a degree in hacking . . . on the whole , then , my advice is to stay away from latex . "" "" i am a linux user , and can assure you that latex and all sorts of extensions work very well with linux . so if you can find the linguistic tools for latex you should be able to use them with linux . "" i have also had a few requests that i share the information regarding where to find latex ipa fonts : there are apparently at least two , maybe more . one is called tsipa and is from japan . another is called wsuipa , and is from washington state university . one other person mentioned a font set from waterloo , but did not give more details . tsipa is available at ftp . shsu . edu in tex-archive / fonts / tsipa a couple people mentioned the tex - for-linguists newsgroup , at listserv @ shsu . edu , but this may no longer be running . there is also a tex newsgroup , comp . text . tex for more info . thanks again to all the people who responded so quickly . i am going to give the linux / latex system a shot , and see what i can make of it . - alex afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu alex francis ( 312 ) - 667-5432 department of linguistics afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu university of chicago ( 312 ) 667-5432 ( home ) 1010 e . 59th st .

0,"sum : sign-singing a few weeks ago i posted the following query : ) here in taiwan there is a tv program in which people compete ) to see who is the best singer . there are different categories ) for different types of songs / languages , etc . , and one category ) is for "" sign singing "" . a tape of a song is played , and a signer ) signs along with the words of the song ( all those i ' ve seen ) compete were not deaf ) . i was wondering if this is common in ) other countries , and if so , what the criteria are for judging ) who is "" the best "" , and also if it is done at all by people ) who are deaf . thanks . i received a number of interesting responses : ) from jane edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : ) thought not pertaining to contests or even singing , for that matter , ) i saw something on pbs a couple months back which i wanted to mention . ) they showed a "" music appreciation "" class taught to totally deaf high school ) kids , in which they each were wearing pad on the back , which converts the ) acoustic output into pressure stimulation . the students were dancing to ) the music , and commenting on different types of music . they were n't ) singing / signing to it , but perhaps they could ? ) from jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) : ) one of the largest , most popular choruses in seattle regularly ) has a sign-language "" interpreter "" on stage during performances ; the ) particular one who has been doing it for a long time is not deaf ; he seems ) to also appeal a lot to the general audience with his expressive , exaggerated ) style . ) from midori yonezawa ( yonezawa @ student . msu . edu ) : ) i believe that there is a sign singing contest because music can be shared ) by everybody and it is natural to want to show different expressions each ) other . ) i learned japanese sign language in japan ( a little bit ) , and sometimes i ) practiced sign singing , too . i went to concerts where the singers were ) all professional "" shanson "" singers ( "" shanson "" is french loan into japanese ) . ) they have a concert every year for those who are handicapped , not only ) for deaf people . some singers sang with sign language at the same time as ) they sang vocally , and when the singers did n't do so there was an interpreter ) of sign language on the stage . i noticed and surprised that the ways of ) expressing by sing language are very different from each other and from ) occasions , e . g . fast / slow , soft / pressing , emotional / calm , etc , etc . . ) i also remember a tv program ( on nhk ) about equipment to help those who have ) difficulty in hearing . a technical group developed the equipment so that ) they can hear music . ) from peggy swartzel lott ( pslott @ utxvms . cc . utexas . edu ) : ) when i was a sign language interpreter and interpreter coordinator in ) san diego , california , there was quite a to-do a few years back over ) the issue of song sign . i first remember encountering song sign in ) the early to mid 70 's when a few groups of deaf performers ( i . e . ) musign ) toured the country performing popular songs in sign along ) with recorded sound tracks . later a pair of excellent performers , ) sharon neumann solow and gary sanderson , both individuals who were ) raised with deaf parents and fluent in asl , toured and performed ) songs in sign . ) ) the controversy in san diego centered on a local "" annual song sign ) competition "" hosted by the area 's rid branch , sanscrid . the ) competition was open to the public and was established both for ) a general "" deaf awareness "" activity and to raise funds for various ) purposes . prizes were given out for best individual song , best ) group , etc . the performance of the competition was quite popular ) and seemed to be growing in attendance and participation each year . ) ) a group of deaf people contested the competition on various grounds . ) the points i remember best about their objection ( because i ) personally found these issues most compelling ) were that the ) actual performances were offensive to some native signers because ) of the way putting sign to music distorted the linguistic and ) aesthetic dynamics of asl . that is , in order to make a signed ) narrative conform to the lyrics of a song , to translate it ) simultaneously with the recorded music , many grammatical patterns ) in normal signing had to be altered . often the performance bore ) little resemblance to normal signing . ) ) there was great debate for a while in the community over this issue . ) certain deaf people and many hearing interpreters and sign ) students defended the practice of song sign . some insisted that ) they be allowed to exercise their own artistic talents in playing ) with signing in this way . others felt that song sign provided an ) important bridge that enabled many uninformed hearing people to ) become aware of and appreciate the beauty of signing . the ) community was divided over the issue and eventuall y the whole ) thing was dropped . in the meantime , however , certain concerns ) of deaf people were brought to the surface and continued to be a ) source of discussion : issues about who has the right to make poetic ) use of signing and what sorts of alterations in signing style are ) acceptable to native users and which are not . i found the whole ) debate quite interesting and was genuinely convinced by the ) argument of the deaf people who were opposed to the practice . ) from richard arnold ( richard . arnold @ vuw . ac . nz ) : ) here in new zealand we have an annual new zealand sign langauge story - telling ) competition . mostly the competitors are deaf , but some codas also partipate as ) well . i have yet to see any hearing compete , however i know of some deaf for ) whom nz sign language is a second language learnt later in their adult life ) also participate . ) ) the winners are usually those who are quite fluent in nzsl . the criteria for ) judging is ( to my understanding ) as follows : ) ) - is the signing clear to the audience ? ) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called "" sweet honey in the ) rock "" who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of "" helpers "" for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst "" loss "" resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like "" tra la la "" or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica

0,"review of arboreal for windows review of : arboreal for windows , cascadilla press . by dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre for cognitive science , university of edinburgh . arboreal for windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is a package designed to facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply of a truetype ( tm ) font in which keys are mapped to tree component shaped characters rather than standard keyboard symbols . the advantage of drawing trees in this way is that arborwin is very portable , and can be used in any wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application which allows you to select specific fonts ( i . e . most ) . the disadvantage , broadly , is that ` type-setting ' or layout of the trees is left to the user . the ` characters ' of arborwin include left , right , vertical , and ` triangle ' branches - - each of several widths ( but all the same height ) . the font is also fully scalable . in general , i found that arborwin behaved as intended , given that it is simply a font-based package . its most basic limitation is that there is a relatively small selection of branch sizes ( i . e . how narrow or wide a branch is ) . in practice , the most common problem i encountered was that ` triangle ' branches ( eg , for phrase without internal structure ) could n't be made wide enough . . . given that one often wants to put fairly long phrases under these . the only way to increase the width was to increase the point size for the branch ; but this also increases the height of the particular branch , and makes trees look disproportionate and inconsistent . being font-based , however , also means it cannot attain the flexibility of alternative packages ( eg , the ` tree ' package for latex ) . the ' tree ' package , for example , takes as input a declarative tree specification ( as a bracketed list ) and then automatically typesets the tree , and also permits crossing branches , and upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , the tree formatting is consistent , and tailored to the size / length of terminals ( including the triangle branches ) . overall the package is simple to use and quite effective if your requirements ( in terms of both sophistication , and layout quality ) are not too demanding . if greater flexibility , consistency , and quality is required , then i believe there is still no substitute for latex and its associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre for cognitive science university of edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk

- - - - - - - - the prolamat conference is an internationally well known event for demonstrating and evaluating activities and progress in the field of discrete manufacturing . sponsored by the international federation for information processing ( ifip ) , the prolamat is traditionally held every three years and it includes the whole area of advanced software technology for design and manufacturing in discrete manufacturing . past conferences have explored : - manufacturing technology , - advances in cad / cam , - software for discrete manufacturing , - software for manufacturing . the eight international prolamat focused on the theme of man in cim . the 1995 prolamat featured the theme of life cycle modelling for innovative products and processes . the 1998 conference in italy will be organized by the university of trento , school of engineeering and department of computer and managemet sciences , jointly with istituto trentino di cultura , under the auspices of the wg2 for "" computer - aided design "" and wg3 for "" computer - aided manufacturing "" of the technical committee 5 for "" computer applications in technology "" . this conference will be the last prolamat before the next century , and it provides an opportunity to investigate and imagine what the digital communications revolution going on all around us will mean for manufacturing . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference subjects -

- - - - - - representations , reuse people , not machines , design new products and make manufacturing systems work . increasingly , groups of people are required to design new products and bring them to market . requirements for agility and the suitability of specific manufacturing processes must be matched with the culture and knowledge base of the work force . world - class processes have floundered when this was not done . information and communication systems can either amplify or reduce the magnitude of differences across culture or engineering discipline . researchers specializing in knowledge representation , modelling , communications , standardization , and reuse will be invited to share their experiences and research perspectives . - enterprise data sharing across engineering , cultural , and supply chain boundaries , - distributed manufacturing and supply chain management - early stage product development which dynamically incorporates supplier constraints - standard models for component information representation , product and process interchange , - technologies for knowledge sharing , collaboration , and across the product lifecycle , - adaptive systems for organizational management , knowledge sharing , education , and training - organizational and manufacturing process simulation - organizing and representing design and manufacturing process for dissemination and reuse - the interface between human and machine for information sharing , training , education , -

0,"sum : verbal / pronominal feature differences earlier this month i posted the following query : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = what languages ( if any ) do people know about , where there are distinctions carried in the verbal morphology which cannot be indicated in the pronominal system ? ( for example , if a language expressed gender differences in the verbs , but not in pronouns ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the following people very kindly replied with various pieces of very useful information : antton elosegi aldasoro ( fvpelala @ sd . ehu . es ) ariel mira ( mariel @ ccsg . tau . ac . il ) "" ellen l . contini - morava "" ( elc9j @ faraday . clas . virginia . edu ) simon corston ( corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu ) brian d joseph ( bjoseph @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu ) june wickboldt : jwickbol @ ucs . indiana . edu here are the replies : the two most promising examples of what i was asking about come from basque and hebrew , where the pronominal and verbal systems do not match for gender : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - antton elosegi aldasoro ( fvpelala @ sd . ehu . es ) in basque there is not gender at all in nouns or pronouns , but some verbal forms carry the distinction of the gender of the 2nd person nik ekarri diat nik ekarri dinat i ( erg ) give it to you-masc i ( erg ) give it to you-fem antton elosegi ( university of the basque country ) ariel mira ( mariel @ ccsg . tau . ac . il ) in my own hebrew "" normal "" verbal inflections ( past and future ) distinguish person gender and number in 2nd and 3rd persons , but only number in 1st person . so far so good , because so does the free pronominal system . however , our now present tense is morphologically a nominal form ( for eg . holexet = ' walk ( fem ) ' as well as ' walker ( fem ) ' . now , our nominal forms , having nothing to do with pronominal forms inflects for number and gender , but does not distinguish persons . the result is that now 1st person present inflection distinguishes between fem and masc though the independent pronoun does not . modern hebrew is losing some gender distinctions too ! 1 . future tense 3rd pers plural : fem form is hardly ever used . even the purist language academy has "" abolished "" the form . ( we do n't seem to ever have had it in past tense ) . 2 . in colloquial speech , the same is happening to 2nd person , no doubt because the 2nd and 3rd person plural fem forms are identical ( though not the masc ones they have converged with ) . 3 . this needs to be checked ! the free plural feminine pronoun , as well as past inflections of same seem to me to be shaking . but real data has to be recorded for this , so do n't make much of this . i wonder whether mixed forms are possible , namely , you-fem go + masc , etc . * and on a more theoretical note * : hopefully you will find very few examples for what you are looking , because i believe ( what others have been saying for about a hundred years ) that inflections tend to develop out of free pronouns . hence , the dependence between the meanings encoded , though there is no principled reason for the inflection to change later , i guess . it is really unlikely , though , because once the form is inflected , fused with the verb , chances are it won't develop its separate semantics . if you ' re interested in theories about the development of inflection out of pronouns , i have my own , which accounts for the well-known fact that inflections for 1st and 2nd person are much more prevalent than 3rd person . i claim this is so not because 3rd person is unmarked , but rather , since referents of 3rd person are usually much less accessible than referents of 1st and 2nd person ( the speaker and the addressee ) . minimal forms are reserved for more accessible referents ( in general ) , hence inflections are the natural development out of free pronouns for highly accessible antecedents . you can have a look at my book ' accessing np antecedents ' , routledge , 1990 , chapter 6 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the following two respondents quote cases where logophoric and obviative marking occur attached to the verb rather than to the pronoun to which they refer . to me , it seems that these particles are not inflections as such , though i am not sure exactly how i would classify them . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - june wickboldt : jwickbol @ ucs . indiana . edu some languages having logophoric reference mark the reference with verbal affixes , not pronouns or pronominals . two are newari , see karen ebert . 1986 . reported speech in some languages of nepal . in f . coulmas ( ed . ) direct and indirect speech , berlin : mouton de gruyter , and gokana , see hyman , larry m . and bernard comrie . 1981 . logophoric reference in gokana . journal of african languages and linguistics . 3 : 19-37 . brian d joseph ( bjoseph @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu ) the algonquian language cree , spoken in canada , has a category known in the literature as "" obviative "" , which provides a way of distinguishing between different third-persons in a discourse ( the first one mentioned is "" proximate "" , and the next one mentioned is "" obviative "" , so cree can distinguish unambiguously between "" john met bill as he was walking down the street "" where rhe "" in english can refer to either john or bill - - in cree it would be unambiguously one or the other ) . for the most part , and this is where it is relevant to you , this marking shows up on the verb ( thus the verb form in the above sentence would be different if it was john walking or bill walking ) ; nouns can show obviative / proximate marking ( though one class , the so-called "" inanimate "" nouns do not ) , and there are proximate and obviative forms of demonstrative pronouns , but not of the personal pronouns . thus "" wi : ya "" is ' he / proximate ' as well as ' he / obviative ' . pronouns are not usually expressed in cree , but if you just look at the personal pronouns , then cree would be a language of the sort you were looking for . for that matter , these facts are similar in virtually all the algonquian languages , so it is n't just cree . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - finally , two respondents noted that independent pronouns are not necessarily marked for case in the same way as pronominal affixes . such phenomena do not seem rare to me ( e . g . arabic does the same ) . i am assuming then that such cases are not marked . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "" ellen l . contini - morava "" ( elc9j @ faraday . clas . virginia . edu ) in swahili part of the verb morphology is subject and object prefixes , that signal info . about participant role with respect to the action of the verb . this distinction is not made among independent pronouns , which distinguish only person and number . but since the subject and object prefixes in swahili are often called "" pronominal "" , i do n't know if this counts as a distinction that can't be made by pronouns . simon corston ( corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu ) in my ma , in press in the pacific linguistics series from anu , i discuss ' ergativity in roviana ' . roviana has special pronominal forms used for absolutive ( s ( 's ubject of intr ' ) or o ( ' object ' ) ) , and different forms for a ( 's ubject of tr ' ) . the pronouns make distinctions in person , number , and incl / ecl for 1pl . there are pronominal verbal affixes on the verb which are always only o . i . e . whereas the independent prons do n't distinguish s / o , the pronominal affixes do . somewhere around here i have a brief sketch of roviana which i have been sending to people . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i found everything very interesting , and am happy to receive any more info on my query above . thanks again to those who responded ! maik gibson university of reading

0,"summary : whatever happened to 'd ? a few weeks ago i posted a query to the list regarding the disappearance of had or its contracted form ' d , in such expressions as she better stop , which appeared in a recent academic publication . i questioned people 's attitudes towards the standardisation of this new form ( better ) , the subsequent status of the bare infinitive ( stop ) , the possibility of its association with the extraposed construction it is better that she stop , ( implying a subjunctive analysis of stop ) and the likelihood of substituting another adjective ( e . g . good ) in place of better has a result of this . i also questioned the possibility of inverting better with the subject in interrogatives , given the analysis of it as an auxiliary form . i received 26 replies , and i would like to thank the following people who sent their comments , and anyone who is yet to do so : tamara al - kasey ; eleanor olds batchelder ; jonathon berg ; claudia brugman ; marsha bundman ; ellen contini - morava ; max copperman ; john cowan ( logical language group ) david fertig ; frederik fouvry ; dorine houston ; marge jackman ; roger lass ; deborah d . kela ruuskanen ; james kirchner ; timothy miller ; catherine rudin ; raphael salkie ; alena sanusi ; hal schiffman ; jane simpson ; dan slobin ; frits stuurman ; larry trask ; ivan uemlianen ; max wheeler . of 18 replies to the question of standardisation , 9 replied that it was not to be considered standard , 9 thought that it was either normal , informal or ok , and 8 did not consider this question . nobody liked the analysis of stop as a subjunctive , 2 people considering that the extraposed derivation sounded educated or stilted . one reply considered that stop was an imperative form . four people replied that better was an auxiliary , 7 thought it was a modal or semi-modal , and 2 thought that the construction was simply idiomatic . john cowan made mention of the use of better in yiddish - influenced american english as a sentence prefix : ' better she should n't go ' . with regard to its inversion in interrogatives , 9 people considered sai was not ok , one person thought it ok to invert in tags , and only one person thought main clause sai sounded ok . i also want to thank frederik fouvry for his reference : "" information based syntax and semantics "" ( hpsg vol . 1 , pollard & sag , 1987 ) in which better is analysed as an auxiliary that does n't allow inversion ; and frits stuurman for his references and comments : in g . gazdar , g . pullum , & i . sag ( 1982 ) "" auxiliaries and related phenomena in a restricted theory of phrase structure "" _ language _ 59 , 3 : 591-638 , pp . 610-611 , there is a reference to aren ' t as a similar case ( aren ' t i vs . i aren ' t ) ; and in gazdar , e . klein , pullum & sag ( 1985 ) _ generalized phrase structure grammar _ ( cambridge , mass . : harvard up ) , p . 64 , and gazdar , pullum & sag ( 1982 ) , p . 611 , footnote 17 , there are references to different meanings of modals like shall and might when inverted for interrogatives . frits stuurman also cites a gpsg reference to the use of better in p . sells ( 1985 ) _ lectures on government - binding theory , generalized phrase structure grammar , and lexical - functional grammar _ ( stanford : csli ) , p . 93 . many people found analogies with other modals that do not invert , e . g . claudia brugman mentions the difficulty of inverting ' she has to stop ' ) * ' has she to stop ? ' and gotta is equally impossible to invert . james kirchner also mentions otta as a similar case . tamara al - kasey compares the negative and the affirmative interrogatives : * ' had she better stop ? ' and ' had n't she better stop ? ' suggesting that the latter is more acceptable . other interesting items were : the vp - deletion version , observed by max wheeler ' we better had ' ; and at least 2 people considered that had seems to return only for inversion for interrogatives . generally , the use of inversion of better + subject was considered more common in tags , especially amongst children or teenagers , and jane simpson thinks that the tag bettern ' t you is now appearing in australian english , with or without the preceding ' d . ivan uemlianen ( british speaker from northern england ) claims he had always used the tag ' bettern ' t i ? ' as a child , which had always struck him as not quite right , and had never heard of the had until he heard it being used in old films . dan slobin considers the use of had to be archaic , or from another variety or era , although the inversion ' better she go ? ' does not appear in the speech of american - english preschoolers in their data . one respondent did n't know where the had came from , and another reanalysed it as would , in the same way as it has been reanalysed in conditional protases . another suggestion was that it was analogous to a pluperfect auxiliary without tense . two replied that the expression she better stop was just an example of sloppy editing . there was little discussion of phonological processes , but , in particular , i found interesting the following comments by roger lass : "" in my dialect anyhow ( new york city middle class ) , it 's certainly normal to say ( and sometimes , in less formal registers , to write ) , i better , you better , he better , we better , they better . . . observe though : all the pronouns end with a vowel , and there are alternative forms , e . g . i 'd better . . . though these are much less common . there is however another type , which is sometimes taken to be better but is n't : you [ b ] better , where there 's a sort of geminate or at least half-long consonant . the very fact that none of the syntactic things you mark with * or ? seem to occur would be an indication that there has not really been any kind of reanalysis , but rather an institutionalization of a fast-speech deletion and / or assimilation , which is creeping up into slower styles ( as often happens ) . in fact the construction itself is weird anyhow , since you had comparative does n't seem to exist , except in archaisms like ' i 'd liefer do that ' ( i can't use it , but i ' ve heard it ) . note also , it 's just occurred to me , that you do n't get deletion of - 'd in * i rather do that . . .

) nature of the sounds that i produced and heard from others around , and also at the way people within a particular church tended to sound like one another ( but slightly different from people attending a different church ) . . . a case of unconscious ' copying ' ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i was told by one observer that i keep my british accent when i sing in tongues ; other people tell me this is not so . to my own ears , the sounds i produce are not like any language i know but they do occur in recurring patterns . i think they have predominantly l 's , s 's and vowels . the most articulate ( as distinct from hagiographic ) evaluation i received was that there are two continental charismatic traditions - a french one concentrating on melodious spontaneous song and a german / english one concentrating on speech . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i wanted to share my own experience : an old quaker minister ( from a very old-fashioned meeting which had come under the influence of pentecostalism ) came on a religious visit to our area and spent the night at our house . during a period of prayer in my living room , he spoke in tongues . i had never heard such a thing before , except in imitation , and i was impressed by the monotony of it . i can't make this machine do a phonetic transcription , but it was ( in a very quiet sing-song ) something like / ' a : ' tikari ' ka : ' tika ti ' ka : ti ' ka : / and then repeated ( the ' = primary stress ) . the shakers , a dying sect here known for their ecstatic group dancing and singing , incorporated "" tongues "" into many of their songs , in stylized form , and there were relatively few syllables used there as well - - ba , lo , ta , ti , ka , la and a few others . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - for a short answer , dredged out of my memory ( i wrote my undergraduate honors paper on this topic in 1973 ! ) : glossolalia is not a language , of course - - its users seem to latch onto and them repeat sounds that sound foreign to them , and intersperse the name jesus in between the sounds - - at least this was the case with glosslalia produced by american english speakers that i heard . jesus was pronounced , as i recall , as in english . many glossolalia users , however , think that they are speaking another human language , and will eagerly press this point to the visiting linguist , anthropologist or undergraduate . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - some years ago as an undergraduate , i memorized the first eleven lines to beowulf . occasionally i recited them to people ( i still do ) . once i recited them to a friend from alabama , and she told me that if i did that back where she came from , folks would say i was speaking in tongues . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - anecdotally , when i was an undergrad , one of my professors mentioned having seen a study or two on glossolalia . the studies indicated that the phoneme inventory was always quite small , smaller than that found in practically any natural language . maybe even smaller than the hawaiian inventory of thirteen phonemes , although my professor did n't go into details . my professor was a fundamentalist christian herself as well as an excellent linguist . she did believe that glossolalia was , at least in some cases , an inspired state and that people in that state were often speaking genuine languages . however , they were n't natural human languages . my professor pointed out that there was no reason to assume that they would be natural human languages , that people could speak in heavenly tongues which are meaningless to those on earth but which do have meaning , even if earthly people can't understand them . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - regards , and thanks j jussi karlgren jussi . karlgren @ sics . se sw inst of comp sc ( sics ) spr } kteknologi / natural language processing box 1263 , 164 28 kista ph + 46 8 752 15 00 , fax + 46 8 751 72 30 stockholm , sweden http : / / sics . se / ~ jussi / jussi-karlgren . html

0,"sum : jakobson reference two months ago ( sorry for the delay ) i posted the following query on the linguist list ( with a horrible spelling error in the subject line ) : ) the following is , i believe , a more or less literal quote from roman jakobson : ) languages differ less in what you can express in them than in what you must ) > express in them . ) does anybody out there have the exact reference ? 1 . reaction to the query = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = six hours later it appeared on the list and three more hours later the first answer was in ! ! ! thank you all , that 's really great ! ! ! within the following four weeks i received ten replies , 5 of them giving the first quotation below , 2 with the second one , 3 asking me to forward the requested information . thanks to all who responded : birgitta englund dimitrova bob fradkin eloise jelinek hans lindquist nili mandelblit bruce mannheim bert peeters larry rosenwald deborah ruuskanen martha thunes 2 . answers = = = = = = = = = = a . the first quotation is : jakobson , roman ( 1959 ) ' on linguistic aspects of translation ' in reuben a . brower ( ed . ) , on translation , cambridge , mass . : harvard university , press . 232-239 . reprint new york : galaxy books 1966 . the quoted sentence is on p . 236 . also in jakobson , roman ( 1971 ) selected writings vol . ii , the hague : mouton . 260-266 . the quoted sentence is here on p . 264 . ( birgitta englund dimitrova mentions that this article has ever since been widely quoted in research on translation . ) the context is the division of labor between lexical and grammatical means , which may vary considerably from language to language , and the problems this poses for translation : "" if some grammatical category is absent in a given language , its meaning may be translated into this language by lexical means . . . . it is more difficult to remain faithful to the original when we translate into a language provided with a certain grammatical category from a language devoid of such a category . . . . as boas neatly observed , the grammatical pattern of a language ( as opposed to its lexical stock ) determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed in the given language . . . . in order to translate accurately the english sentence "" i hired a worker , "" a russian needs supplementary information , whether this action was completed or not and whether the worker was a man or a woman . . . ) languages differ essentially in what they _ must _ convey and not in what they ) > _ may _ convey . each verb of a given language imperatively raises a set of specific yes-no - questions . . . "" b . the second quotation is : jakobson , roman ( 1959 ) ' boas ' view of grammatical meaning ' in w . goldschmidt ( ed . ) , the anthropology of franz boas , memoirs of the american anthropological association 89 . 139-45 . reprinted in jakobson , roman ( 1971 ) selected writings vol . ii , the hague : mouton . 489-496 . the quoted sentence is on p . 492 . here the context is boas ' obligatoriness criterion for the distinction between grammatical and lexical meaning . jakobson quotes from boas : "" . . . ' a paucity of obligatory aspects does not by any means imply obscurity of speech . when necessary , clarity can be obtained by adding explanatory words . ' to denote time or plurality , those languages which have no tense or grammatical number resort to lexical means . ) thus the true difference between languages is not in what may or may not be ) > expressed but in what must or must not be conveyed by the speakers . "" ( am i right as a non-native speaker of english in suspecting that my fellow non-native speaker has possibly confounded ' must not ' with ' need not ' ? ) 3 . motivation for the query = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i am using the ( first ) quote in a typological context , as motto for a paper where i discuss some of the consequences the obligatoriness of definiteness and number marking has for those cases of use where the speaker wants to evade these constraints . i argue there that languages with a high degree of explicitness ( many obligatory choices ) also provide for standard weakening strategies . if any typologist out there wants to engage in a discussion about the explicitness parameter , i would be happy to hear from him . to trigger the appropriate keywords , let me just mention that james huang 's ' temperature ' parameter ( the metaphor goes back , via haj ross , to marshall mcluhan ) is just a special case of the explicitness parameter . according to huang ( li 15 , 1984 , pp . 531-574 ) , languages with a high degree of obligatoriness in the expression of anaphoric elements are ' hot ' ( little audience participation required ) , whereas languages with a preference for zero anaphora are ' cool ' ( more audience participation required ) . let me conclude with another quote from the first paper of rj : "" equivalence in difference is the cardinal problem of language and the pivotal concern of linguistics .

0,"summary : c - insertion some weeks ago i posted a query as to whether anyone knew examples of consonant insertion to separate impermissible vowel clusters , in which the choice of consonant was not conditioned by its surrounding vowels . thanks who all those who responded . their names and e-mail addresses appear with their edited remarks . i would welcome further comments on anything brought up in this summary . reason for the query : my query was prompted by work i ' ve been doing on the czech verb system in which , in certain forms from certain paradigms , a glide / j / appears that is not present in other forms . ( since most e-mail won't support czech diacritics , i ' ll spell all czech forms phonetically . an apostrophe after a consonant indicates its palatalization . ) typical of such verbs is the verb [ d ' elat ] "" to do "" : [ d ' ela : ] "" he / she / it does "" [ d ' elaji : ] "" they do "" [ d ' elaji : c ] active participle ( plural ) in old church slavonic and in russian , this / j / appears in all persons of the present tense in related paradigms ( e . g . , russian [ d ' elajet ] "" to do "" 3rd per . sing . ) and creates a vjv sequence , which historically contracted into a long vowel in czech ( e . g . , [ d ' ela : ] ) . in most current phonological accounts of west slavic languages , such as rubach ( 1993 ) , this / j / is considered to be present underlyingly , but then needs to be deleted in almost all forms of these verbs . this representation seemed too abstract to me , and when i considered czech phonotactic restrictions ( see charts in palkova ( 1994 ) ) from an autosegmental viewpoint , it occurred to me that the / j / ( where it does survive ) may simply be inserted to break up impermissible v clusters or to prevent formation of overlong syllable nuclei . the only sticking point in this was that / j / often appears between non-high vs or vs with which it shares no obvious features . as i found out from the responses and from searching i ' ve done since , the epenthesis of consonants between non-homorganic vowels is not as uncommon as one might assume . so far , the norm seems to be that cs inserted at morpheme boundaries will be glides ( even between non-high vs ) unless there is a relic consonant that has been retained , and sometimes analogically extended , in a given environment . in all cases i ' ve found where the inserted c is a relic , that c is coronal . more data would be greatly welcome . the responses : albert ortmann ( ortmann @ sapir . ling . uni-duesseldorf . de ) mentioned several examples : english intrusive / r / , french t-epenthesis in interrogative forms , dutch insertion of / j / and / v / between non-high vs morpheme internally ( e . g . , theater [ te : ' ( j ) a : t @ r ] ; zovals [ zo : ' ( v ) als ] "" like , as if "" ) , and swiss german insertion of / n / between certain hosts and clitics ( e . g . groesser wie-n - i "" taller than - ep - i "" ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : vowel clusters from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk x - from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk ( dr james m scobbie ) some people might think that / r / sandhi in english is of the type you are looking for , but really / r / is just the consonantal glide counterpart of non-high vowels , so it 's just like finding / j / near / i / or / w / near / u / . note , however , that to avoid inserting / r / in certain socially stigmatised environments , many speakers insert glottal stop : law [ ? ] and order instead of law [ r ] and order = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : c - insertion from : seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu ( steve seegmiller ) karachay , a turkic language , has a clear case of a consonant appearing under certain circumstances involving what would otherwise be v - v sequences . the plural suffix is - le or - la ( depending on vowel harmony ) , so that at ' horse ' has the plural atla . however , if the plural suffix is itself followed by another suffix beginning with a vowel , an - r - appears : atlari "" m ' my horses ' .

0,"8 - bit characters dear fellow linguists : in the past months i have read several postings to this list using languages other than english ( spanish , german , french , finnish , italian , etc . ) . i consider this situation absolutely delicious , as it adds that international flavour that our discipline is so proud of . as english is not my native tongue , i welcome and exercise my right to use my language in all contexts . however , the notorious difficulty that 8 - bit characters have to travel in the cyberspace has made it really hard to send texts that comply with the spelling conventions of these languages ( basically accented and umlauted vowels , greek letters and certain other symbols ) . this is not a big problem when you are just sending a relatively short e-message to a colleague who speaks the same language ( you just drop the accents and type plain vowels or capitals instead , for enye you type a plain "" n "" , etc . ) . the real trouble arises when you wish to send a more polished document such as a paper , an abstract , a conference posting , a bibliography , a draft of a thesis to a distant supervisor , etc . in most of these cases the spelling norms * are * crucial . the obvious solution is the coding of 8 - bit characters as sequences of 7 - bit characters . i think that this has become a common practice , but i do n't know whether there is a standard for these conversions . if this coding practice has not yet been the object of standardisation , i venture to propose one below . this proposal refers to the characters available in the extended character set on ibm pc - compatible computers ( i am not familiar with mac , but this could also be used in that system ) . i would like to stress the fact that it is not necessary to type the ( long ) document using the coding system , rather the file must typed as usual , with accented and umlauted vowels as well as the rest of the characters needed in the language , and just after that you make a copy of the file and on that copy you change the 8 - bit characters for 7 - bit sequences according to the table provided . this procedure is * not * manual , for this you use the search-and - replace facility normally available in your word processor or editor ( remember : the dos editor has it ) . this can be done for most languages in ten or fewer passes ( less than one minute , varying with the size of the file ) . it is important to let the recipient know that you have coded the file in this fashion . append a note at the beginnig of the document to that effect , with a suggestion to use the search-and - replace facility to make the reverse changes , as well as the table of changes and samples . feel free to edit ( and / or translate ) what follows if you wish to make the note shorter by including only what is pertinent for a given language . | a . model of a note :

0,"summary : expletive negation in modern hebrew on february 27 , i posted a querry on expletive negation in modern hebrew . i want to thank ariel cohen ( ariel _ cohen @ riga . mt . cs . cmu . edu ) , michael ephratt ( rhlh702 @ uvm . haifa . ac . il ) , bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) , laurence horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) , paul rowlett ( p . a . rowlett @ mod - lang . salford . ac . uk ) and lucia tovena ( tovena @ latl . unige . ch ) for their comments . my querry originated from michael moore 's comment to the effect that in modern hebrew , the sentence negation of subordinate clauses dominated by before , until and i ' m afraid can be interpreted referentially or expletively . according to ariel cohen , only until contexts allow an expletive negation . bob fradkin mentionned that expletive negation in mh seemed less frequent than in french . while it seems that expletive negation in mh has a narrower domain of use than in french , there might also be a question of style involved here ; while expletive negation is an aknowledged grammatical feature of formal style in french , it might be a non-standard feature of mh . this is suggested to me by the fact that neither glinert 1989 suggested by michael ephratt nor rosen 1977 even mention expletive negation in mh . lucia tovena pointed me to her 1994 paper in geneva generative papers about italian , hungarian and hindi expletive negation in until contexts . for a typological overview of expletive negation , one can consult horn 1978 , which shows the typological extension of the phenomenon . now , i ' m still left with a few unanswered questions . i ' m surprised that there apparently does n't exist any study on the topic in mh . i wonder whether i should be looking in the direction of ancient hebrew . a question of more general interest is how to deal with divergent distributions of a phenomenon across languages ; in other words , how should the fact that expletive negation exists in comparative and fearing contexts in a large number of languages but not in mh ? ? could matters of style , as suggested above , explain this ? ? thanks for those who responded and for those who will . - glinert , l . , 1989 , the grammar of modern hebrew , cambridge up . - horn , l . , 1978 , some aspects of negation , j . greenberg , universals of human language , vol . 4 , standford up , 127-210 . - moore , m . , 1992 , double negation , et cetera , 304-309 . - rosen , 1977 , contemporary hebrew . pierre larrivee departement de langues et linguistique , universite laval , quebec , canada , g1k 7p4 3914larp @ vm1 . ulaval . ca

0,"item for linguist in memoriam simon c . dik ( 1940-1995 ) it is with great sadness that we inform you of the death , on march 1 , 1995 , of simon c . dik , one of the world 's leading theoreticians in functional linguistics . simon had occupied the chair of general linguistics at the university of amsterdam for 25 years when in 1994 his illness , which had manifested itself two years earlier , forced him to resign . during these 25 years he developed the theory of functional grammar , the foundations for which had been laid in his 1968 dissertation on coordination . as far as his illness allowed him , simon continued working on the further development of this theory until his death . the results of this work , the two-volume ' the theory of functional grammar ' , will be published posthumously . during his career simon has been a constant source of inspiration and encouragement , both as a teacher and as a scholar , for his colleagues and students . the significance of his work for the field of linguistics and the effectivity of the enormous energy which he put into promoting linguistic research deserve our recognition and gratitude . we , members of the community of linguists working within the framework of functional grammar , especially feel the loss of our personal contacts with him . we gratefully acknowledge his unending and invaluable involvement in the progress of linguistic research until the very end . simon leaves behind his wife willy , his daughters iris and hester , and his son remco . machtelt bolkestein ( ot @ alf . let . uva . nl ) casper de groot ( casperdg @ alf . let . uva . nl ) kees hengeveld ( khengeveld @ alf . let . uva . nl )

0,"special issue cl journal / finite state methods . . . please post or distribute call for papers computational linguistics special issue on finite state methods in natural language processing recent years has seen a substantial increase in the use of finite state techniques in many aspects of natural language processing as mature tools for building large scale finite-state systems from various research laboratories and universities become available . this trend was by no means foreseen as late as ten years ago given the well-known demonstration by noam chomsky in 1957 that finite-state methods are inherently incapable of representing the full richness of constructions in a natural language . nevertheless , it is evident now that there are many subsets of natural language that are adequately covered by finite-state means and that there are many other areas where finite-state approximations of more powerful formalisms are of great practical benefit . as a follow-up to the fsmnlp ' 98 , international workshop on finite state methods in natural language processing , it was proposed that a collection of papers in this area be published as a special issue of the computational linguistics journal . we would to encourage authors of the papers presented at this workshop , as well as all others who would like to contribute , to submit full versions of their papers for consideration for this special issue . guest editors : lauri karttunen ( xerox research centre europe , france ) kemal oflazer ( bilkent university , turkey ) guest editorial board eric brill ( johns hopkins university , md , usa ) eva ejerhed ( umea university , sweden ) ronald m . kaplan ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) martin kay ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) george kiraz ( bell laboratories , nj , usa ) andrs kornai ( bbn , ma , usa ) mehryar mohri ( at&t labs research , nj , usa ) mark - jan nederhof ( dfki , germany ) atro voutilainen ( university of helsinki , finland ) submission details please submit 6 copies of your hard-copy manuscript to lauri karttunen xerox research centre europe 6 chemin de maupertuis meylan , 38240 , france by monday , october 19 , 1998 . the format of the submission should follow the general submission requirements of the journal . manuscripts for computational linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper ( 8 . 5 by 11 inches , or a4 ) , double-spaced throughout , including footnotes and references . the paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words . manuscripts must be written in english .

0,"new book from mitwpl : phonology - syntax interface new book in phonology available from mit working papers in linguistics in 1998 : truckenbrodt , hubert ( 1995 ) . phonological phrases : their relation to syntax , focus , and prominence . mit dissertation . 194 pages . $ 12 . abstract this thesis investigates what forces relate phonological phrases to the syntactic representation , to focus , and to the representation of prominence . the proposal that is defended is that there is a triangle of syntactic constituency , prosodic constituency , and phrasal prominence , in which the grammar places a simple demand on each pair in the triangle : ( a ) syntactic phrases must be contained in phonological phrases . ( b ) phonological phrases must have edgemost phrasal prominence . ( c ) syntactic phrases must contain phrasal prominence . these demands are taken to interact with one another as ranked and violable constraints , where variation among languages is expressed in terms of constraint reranking . each relation is argued for independently . the effects of ( a ) ( previously analyzed as the role of government in phonological phrasing ) will be investigated on patterns of phrasing in the bantu languages chi mwi : ni , chichewa , and kimatuumbi . the effects of ( b ) , it is argued , can be seen most clearly in the effects of focus on phrasing , where chichewa and japanese will be discussed as examples . the effects of ( c ) , finally , which have been discussed in different contexts as either a directionality parameter of the role of depth of embedding in the assignment of stress , will be argued to have desirable typological consequences that set ( c ) apart from some of its competitors . jointly , the constraints will be seen to derive an end-based typology of the kind familiar from work by lisa selkirk . ordering information : http : / / broca . mit . edu / mitwpl . web / wpls . html

0,"syllable structure and gesture timing call for papers : syllable stucture and gesture timing as part of the conference lp ' 98 to be held at ohio state university sept . 15-20 , there will be a workshop funded by the national science foundation sept . 19-20 , on ' syllable structure and gesture timing ' , covering issues related to phonetic and phonological accounts of segmentation , and timing and ordering of gestures in speech , especially how sequences of consonants e . g . [ spr ] , [ ntw ] are formally represented . speech is traditionally represented as a string of segments , defined in terms of features which are implemented simultaneously . in that conception , the phoneme is the minimal phonological unit where time and ordering are defined . as has long been known , the transition from phoneme to phoneme is phonetically realized as a continuous change . there has been a steady progression in phonological theory from linear generative theory to nonlinear representations where the mapping between segments and features is quite relaxed , and highly articulated suprasegmental structures are assumed . a consequence of nonlinear models , which allow single 's egments ' to bear multiple values of a feature and allow one feature to be associated with many 's egments ' , is that one can meaningfully question the existence of the 's egment ' as a formal object . the theory of feature geometry does not explicitly represent the notion 's egment ' , and it has been argued that the traditional segment does not correspond to any specific level of representation in current models . nonlinear models have increasingly tended towards positing complex but internally timeless single 's egments ' in place of clusters of segments : thus , what was formerly represented as a triconsonantal sequence [ ntw ] might also be represented as a single segment , a ' voiceless prenasalised rounded alveolar ' . some languages , such as bella coola and georgian , seem to allow unbounded arbitrary sequences of consonants , which suggests that phonological theory may ultimately need to allow infinitely long syllables and unstructured onsets and codas . one of the central questions to be taken up in the workshop is "" are there any universal limits on possible strings of segments in various positions within the syllable "" ? this statement of the question begs two quite important questions : do segments per se exist ( and how can one identify whether a given temporal stretch of the phonetic output corresponds to one or more segments ) , and do syllables themselves exist ? both of these assumptions remain controversial , especially in nonlinear phonology . invited speakers for this workshop include donca steriade , john ohala , john harris and louis goldstein . further details on the issues being investigated in this workshop can be found at http : / / ling . ohio-state . edu / events / phon _ workshop . html . one - page abstracts for 30 minute papers to be presented at this workshop are solicited ( due date for receipt of abstracts : august 10 ) . lodging and up to $ 400 to cover economy travel expenses will be provided to authors presenting papers at the workshop . abstracts may be sent by email to odden @ ling . ohio-state . edu , or by surface mail to : syllable workshop department of linguistics ohio state university columbus , oh 43210 please include a surface mail address , email address , and phone number .

0,"syntax / syntax - semantics interface potsdam , eric ; syntactic issues in the english imperative ; 0-8153 - 3129 - 0 , cloth ; pages , $ 97 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this book investigates long-standing problems in the syntactic analysis of the english imperative . most earlier works within the generative tradition have claimed that the syntax of imperatives idiosyncratically and irreducibly differs from that of other english clauses . this work argues that , on the contrary , the imperative has a largely regular syntax which is fully compatible with current formal grammars of english . the putative differences reside primarily in three domainsthe behavior of the auxiliary verbs "" have "" and "" be , "" the options for subjects , and the word order in negative and emphatic clauses . this study addresses each of these controversial domains in turn and argues that the behavior of the imperative is unexceptional in each case . the work is unique in attempting to assimilate the syntax of the english imperative to better-established analyses of english originally developed for other areas of the language . in defending this thesis , the work analyzes word order , constituent structure , and semantic restrictions in the imperative . analyses of two core phenomena in english syntax , adverb placement and vp ellipsis , are also defended . this in-depth investigation of syntactic and semantic aspects of the modern english imperative will be of interest to scholars of syntactic theory , english linguistics , and english grammar . e - mail : info @ garland . com

0,"special issue of cl journal - finite state methods in nlp call for papers computational linguistics special issue on finite state methods in natural language processing recent years has seen a substantial increase in the use of finite state techniques in many aspects of natural language processing as mature tools for building large scale finite-state systems from various research laboratories and universities become available . this trend was by no means foreseen as late as ten years ago given the well-known demonstration by noam chomsky in 1957 that finite-state methods are inherently incapable of representing the full richness of constructions in a natural language . nevertheless , it is evident now that there are many subsets of natural language that are adequately covered by finite-state means and that there are many other areas where finite-state approximations of more powerful formalisms are of great practical benefit . as a follow-up to the fsmnlp ' 98 , international workshop on finite state methods in natural language processing , it was proposed that a collection of papers in this area be published as a special issue of the computational linguistics journal . we would to encourage authors of the papers presented at this workshop , as well as all others who would like to contribute , to submit full versions of their papers for consideration for this special issue . guest editors : lauri karttunen ( xerox research centre europe , france ) kemal oflazer ( bilkent university , turkey ) guest editorial board eric brill ( johns hopkins university , md , usa ) eva ejerhed ( umea university , sweden ) ronald m . kaplan ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) martin kay ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) george kiraz ( bell laboratories , nj , usa ) andrs kornai ( bbn , ma , usa ) mehryar mohri ( at&t labs research , nj , usa ) mark - jan nederhof ( dfki , germany ) atro voutilainen ( university of helsinki , finland ) submission details please submit 6 copies of your hard-copy manuscript to lauri karttunen xerox research centre europe 6 chemin de maupertuis meylan , 38240 , france by monday , october 19 , 1998 . the format of the submission should follow the general submission requirements of the journal . manuscripts for computational linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper ( 8 . 5 by 11 inches , or a4 ) , double-spaced throughout , including footnotes and references . the paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words . manuscripts must be written in english .

"" provides new constraints on natural language and on the internal language in which meaning is mentally represented . most syntax takes the sentence as the basic unit for well-formedness , but definitions force us to focus on words and phrases , and hence to focus on compositional syntax in parallel with compositional semantics . this study examines both dictionary definitions and definitions from textbooks from the points of view of their syntax , semantics , and use for learning word meaning . the tools used throughout are principles and parameters syntax , relevance theoretic pragmatics , model theoretic semantics , and the formal theory of definitions . the analyses argue that because phrases can be understood in isolation , some standard syntactic analyses must be modified . ' np movement ' has to be reanalysed as transmission of theta roles . these ideas are then applied to a variety of adjectives which take propositional complements . the final chapter argues that for definitions to be understood , the syntax of the language of thought must be close to that of natural language in specifiable ways . for example , semantic types must be common to the two languages . the book will be of interest to linguists concerned with syntax , semantics and pragmatics ; philosophers of mind and of language ; and lexicographers . e - mail : info @ garland . com

0,"linguistic theory dominique sportiche , partitions and atoms of clause structure subjects , agreement , case and clitics this collection builds on the theory of principles and parameters and its economy - - minimalist descendants . the essays progressively develop a view of syntactic structures in which syntactic properties are increasingly analyzed as atomized in progressively smaller elementary components and partitioned in the way these elementary components are represented . dominique sportiche argues that as a consequence of this view , languages do not differ at all in their syntactic organization . routledge leading linguists routledge : 1998 : 448 pp cl : 0 415 16926 7 : # d4946 : $ 110 . 00 laura a . michaelis , aspectual grammar and past time reference this work examines the linguistic constructions which speakers use to talk about events that occurred in the past and states which held in the past . laura michaelis argues that the fundamental conceptual division between events and states forms the basis of systems of verbal aspect in all languages , and that one cannot talk about the meaning of a past-tense assertion without making reference to the event-state distinction . focusing on english data , the author examines the semantic and functional overlap between assertions about the past and assertions involving events : when one asserts that an event of a given kind exists , one is making an assertion about the past . this semantic overlap can be evoked as a way of characterizing the close relationship between the past-tense construction and the past-perfect construction : while a past tense assertion like she left is used to describe the past , a present-perfect assertion like she has left is used to assert the existence of an event by invoking its aftermath ( her absence ) . dr . michaelis argues that the two constructions are semantically equivalent , but distinguished by their function in narrative . this study presents a semantic framework for analyzing all aspectual constructions in terms of the event-state distinction , and describes the grammatical expression of aspectual meaning in terms of a theory of grammatical constructions . in this theory , grammatical constructions , like words , are conventionalized form-meaning pairs , which are best described not only with respect to their intrinsic semantic values , but also with respect to the functional opposition in which they participate . michaelis argues that many of the otherwise puzzling grammatical constraints which characterize the english present-perfect construction can be motivated in terms of the functional opposition between present perfect and past tense . routledge studies in germanic linguistics 4 routledge : 1998 : 320 pp cl : 0 415 15678 5 : # d4385 : $ 90 . 00 asa kasher , ed , pragmatics 6 volume set the purpose of this collection is to portray the development of pragmatics as a science of language , in a such a way as to enable readers to critically assess this theorectical development . issues explored include * presupposition * implicature * discourse * grammar * communication * indexicals * psychology * sociology . this work provides highly useful references and suggestions for further reading , and has an exceptionally detailed subject and name index to enable easy and immediate access for the reader . critical concepts routledge : 1998 : 2653 pp cl : 0 415 11734 8 : # d2960 : $ 905 . 00 for more information on these and other titles from : routledge london * new york in north america : www . routledge-ny . com elsewhere : www . routledge . com

postposed position is reserved for information that is ' new ' in one of a small number of distinct senses ; and argument-reversing constructions require that the information represented by the preverbal constituent be at least as familiar within the discourse as that represented by the postverbal constituent . within each of the three classes of constructions , individual constructions vary with respect to whether they are sensitive to familiarity within the discourse or ( assumed ) familiarity within the hearer 's knowledge store . thus , although the individual constructions in question are subject to distinct constraints , this work provides empirical evidence for the existence of strong correlations between sentence position and information status . the final chapter presents crosslinguistic data showing that these correlations are not limited to english . the structure of the lexicon in functional grammar hella olbertz , kees hengeveld & jesus sanchez garcia ( eds . ) ( university of amsterdam ) 1998 . xii , 312 pp . studies in language companion series , 43 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 929 5 price : usd 69 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3046 3 price : nlg 138 , - - the papers collected in this volume concern five different aspects of the role of the lexicon in the theory of functional grammar as developed by simon c . dik and his co-workers . the volume starts off with a practical introduction to the functional - lexematic model and model applications to english , german and spanish are presented . the second part of the volume deals with the derivation of action-nouns , pseudo-reflexive verbs and causative constructions , thus offering new perspectives on predicate formation within functional grammar . this is followed by a section that centers around an important problem related to valency : the question of how to account for the collocational properties of predicates . the fourth part of the book discusses ( non-prototypical ) transitive verbs and their relation to the typology of states of affairs . the final section focuses on the relationship between the lexicon and the underlying structure of the clause . check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /

0,"lexical semantic tagging lexical semantic tagging a special issue of the journal of natural language engineering guest editors : marc light and martha palmer call for papers note : deadline for submissions is november 1st , 1998 computing semantic representations is crucial for many applications of natural language processing . currently , semantic lexicons and sets of semantic composition rules are hand-crafted by the designers of the nlp system . the difficulty of building such hand-crafted semantic knowledge bases has limited the field of nlp to applications that can be contained within well-defined subdomains . the likely escape from this limitation will come from the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisition . however , the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on a computational lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods . one of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy : what constitutes a clear separation into senses of a word , and how can they be computationally characterized and distinguished ? the answer to this question is critical to breaking the bottleneck of broad coverage semantic representation computation . a first step towards finding an answer lies in acquiring annotated corpora that will facilitate the use of empirical methods . the topic of this special issue is tagging word tokens in corpora with lexical semantic information . a concrete example of such tagging would be specifying the sense of an ambiguous word , like { \ em bank } , being used in a particular sentence in a corpus . lexical semantic tagging is critical to extending reliable co-reference for information extraction tasks , to widening the scope of responses to information retrieval queries , to more robust dialogue understanding , and to machine translation . in machine translation in particular , it is often necessary to disambiguate a polysemous source word in order to translate it correctly , since the target language may have distinct lexical items for different senses . we solicit articles which either : ( i ) discuss the characteristics of information to be tagged and how human tagging ( hand-tagging ) can be performed so as to maximize accuracy . such articles should concentrate on the specification of the task and also deal with issues in providing sufficient quantities of accurate and diverse hand-tagged data for the automatic approaches . ( ii ) discuss attempts to develop automated methods and their operation and performance . these articles should describe actual running systems and their design and implementation . we are particularly interested in discussions of lexical semantic tagging methods which are part of actual applications . format : in the interest of providing more coverage , we will be considering papers that are somewhat shorter than traditional journal papers . this would allow us to accept a maximum of 9 articles given an average length of 10 pages . schedule : november 1st , 1998 : submission deadline february 15th , 1999 : notification of acceptance please send submissions to : martha palmer institute for research in cognitive science 400a , 3401 walnut street / 6228 university of pennsylvania philadlephia , pa 19104 telephone : ( 215 ) 898-0361 fax no . : ( 215 ) 573-9247 e-mail : mpalmer @ cis . upenn . edu

0,"glow ' 99 call for papers : glow 1999 the glow 99 colloquium will be organized by the research center for general linguistics ( zas ) in berlin from 29th to 31st march 1999 . the conference will then continue in potsdam on 1st april with parallel workshops organized by the potsdam university and lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) . themes of the conference main colloquium : universals workshops : phonetics in phonology sources for universals technical aspects of movement calls : the colloquium : universals the search for universals has always been at the center of interest in generative linguistics . fundamental claims about universal properties of language are what we build into the very architecture of the theory of ug : primitives ( features etc . ) , combinatorial operations ( merge ) , the operation ' move ' , interfaces with extralinguistic systems ( lf , pf ) , etc . alongside such formal universals , we also seek substantive universals in inventories , markedness patterns , feature hierarchies etc . such facts may reflect properties of ug itself or derive from extralinguistic sources . recent growth in crosslinguistic study opens new opportunities for extending the empirical base , confirming or challenging old generalizations and establishing new ones . at the same time , recent theoretical developments in both phonology and syntax lead to important questions concerning the formal and / or substantive nature of universals in language , and the quest for the exact sources of variation between languages . in phonology , universals have typically been assumed to exist in many different subcomponents , e . g . features , prosodic constituents . only in recent years , with the emergence of output-based evaluation systems , has the focus of interest in universals shifted to the study of constraints and their interaction . hence new questions arise : are all constraints universal in the sense that they are constitutive of grammar ? should we conceive of constraints as being exhaustive and ordered ? are there universals that constraint orderings have to obey ? are there different domains ( i . e . lexical and postlexical level ) where constraints apply ? are there language-specific constraints ? syntactic theory in the early 80 's assumed principles common to all languages to interact with various types of ' macro-parameters ' : one deep property from which several other properties derive ( e . g . pro-drop parameter ) . later , variation was attributed to ' micro-parameters ' . now , with the emergence of minimalism and optimality , basic issues like what constitutes a universal principle / constraint , and what constitutes a parameter , need to be re-addressed . is there a universal inventory of functional heads / features ? as to the autonomy of , or the division of labour between syntax and morphology : is parametrized variation confined to inflectional systems ? is syntactic variation restricted to the choice of overt or zero realization of a given feature ? if all movement takes place in a single cycle , does variation reduce to the presence of affixes or the lack thereof ? are there universal constraints in morpho-syntax ? moreover , in recent years it has been argued that thematic relations are features . what are their characteristics ? do these have a universal inventory ? could they be parametrized ? many typological-descriptive generalizations await theoretical integration - e . g . greenbergian ' universals ' of word order patterns , cross-categorial harmony effects , etc . in this respect , kayne 's proposal for a universal ordering merely shifts the burden from phrase structure to movement . a guiding heuristic of generative grammar has been that parsimonious ( redundancy-free ) theories are to be preferred ; but minimalism goes further in suggesting that economy is built into ug itself . to what extent can the hypothesis that ug principles instantiate notions of economy be upheld ? in studying ug , we take the external systems with which it interfaces to be invariant in linguistically significant senses across individuals and languages . thus we posit universal interpretation mechanisms ( and uniformity across languages at lf ) , ' universal phonetics ' ( invariant articulatory / perceptual mechanisms ) , a universal parser , etc . ; so that variation is confined to grammars , in particular phonology / morphology and&nbsp ; aspects of the lexicon . yet properties of external systems may have far-reaching consequences for our view of ug . as we learn more about them , universals attributed to ug may have to be reassigned . what if ug - compatible grammars determine languages that cannot exist because they are unuseable ( unparseable ; unlearnable ; etc ) ?

( attempts to derive the c-command relation from the minimalist operation merge take this strategy even further . ) yet , head-movement configurations , analyzed as adjunction in the principles and parameters variant of generative grammar , seem to require weaker versions of c-command , such that the adjoined head ' inherits ' the c-command domain of the head adjoined to . it is an open question , whether there are alternatives that do not - one way or the other - employ similar auxiliary devices . as is well known , fgd - patterns ( nested / crossed ) have consequences for the generative power of the grammars describing them . it is not properly understood , however , which devices of which systems capture less orderly patterns best . systems using slash-categories or similar techniques seem to run into considerable difficulty here . feature - lists integrated into a checking theory of movement may be considered one of various alternatives . most recently , the minimalist adoption of the "" copy theory of movement "" opened up another array of related issues . how , for example , do checking resources get eliminated if each step leading to elimination is preceded by a step of copying these resources ? are copies of np / wh - moved constituents assumed to retain properties of empty anaphors and syntactic variables respectively , or has any reference to empty categories ( e . g . ecp ) and their potential link to binding theory become undefined ? if the latter , could this change be motivated by complexity results concerning the powerful device of free indexation , as employed by gb binding theory ? indeed , a general ban on the use of indices has been accompanying the "" copy theory of movement "" . this calls for a demonstration how chains , the standard "" legitimate lf - objects "" , which in alternative versions of syntax are supposed to fully supplant movement , get handled without such devices . primary properties to be defined on chains of copies , for example , would be pf - realizability as well as the distinction between operator , variable , and descriptive content status at lf ( nontrivial consequences for the analyses of qr and acd being directly implied ) . alternatively , it would be helpful to be able to appreciate how far any worked-out proposals deviate from structure-sharing techniques as used in hpsg / lfg ( a . o . ) , index percolation devices from variants of indexed grammar , and other structure generating systems like tree adjoining grammar or categorial grammar . this workshop invites submissions of papers shedding light on the above questions from both technical / formal and linguistic angles . abstracts for both workshops are invited for 45 minute presentations ( plus 15 minutes dicussion ) . they should not exceed one page / 500 words . please send five anonymous copies plus a camera ready original ( with author 's name , address , and affiliation ) to the address specified below . speakers will be partially reimbursed for their expenses on the scale that applies to the colloquium . glow workshops c / o matthias schlesewsky institut fuer linguistik universitt potsdam postfach 60 15 53 d 14415 potsdam germany phone : x49 - 331-977 - 2016 fax : x49 - 331-977 - 2761 e-mail : glow _ workshop @ ling . uni-potsdam . de url : http : / / www . ling . uni-potsdam . de / ik / glow . html 3 . phonetics in phonology invited speakers : edward flemming , donca steriade organizers : carlos gussenhoven , ren kager the workshop is broadly concerned with the relevance of articulatory and perceptual facts for phonological theory . more specifically , it intends to focus on such questions as the extent to which functional factors determine phonological grammars , the status of the distinction between phonological representation and phonetic implementation , the issue of multiple ( articulation-based as well as perception-based ) phonological representations , and the universality and ` groundedness ' of phonological constraints . the workshop will consist of approximately 7 talks of 45 minutes each , followed by 15 minutes of discussion . abstracts may not exceed one page with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font no smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in threefold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation , to glow phonology workshop c / o . ren kager utrecht institute of linguistics / ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht netherlands phone : + 31-30 - 2538064 fax : + 31-30 - 2536000 deadline for submission of abstracts : december 1 , 1998 submission by fax or e-mail will not be accepted .

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with an embedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to "" embedded mt "" is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines and on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of the workshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems are treated in different embedded mt systems ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 note : now , august 24 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 note : now , september 17 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

0,"workshop on embodied conversational characters call for participation the first workshop on embodied conversational characters with support of aaai cooperation of acm / sigchi granlibakken resort & conference center at lake tahoe tahoe city ( north shore ) california , usa october 12-15 , 1998 recent advances in several core software technologies have made possible a new type of human-computer interface : the conversational character . conversational characters are autonomous , anthropomorphic , animated figures that have the ability to communicate through multiple modalities , including spoken language , facial expressions , and gestures . unlike textual natural language interfaces , conversational characters have the ability to perceive and produce the verbal and non-verbal signals that identify discourse structure and regulate the flow of information between interlocutors . such signals include intonational patterns , gestures , back-channel feedback signals , and turn-taking protocols . these capabilities enable them to engage in complex interactions with human users via natural speech rather than complex command languages , menus or graphical manipulations . research on conversational characters has emerged from a number of disciplines , including , among others , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics , computer animation , computer vision , psychology , cognitive science , virtual reality , cscw , and hci . this diversity is naturally reflected in the broad range of active research areas in conversational character interfaces . the primary goal of this workshop is to advance the state of conversational character research and development by identifying novel approaches to the topics and issues listed below , and integrating them into a framework for embodied , conversational human-computer interaction . a provisional program can be found at http : / / www . fxpal . com / wecc98 / . attendance attendance will be limited to 40 people . there will be space for a few attendees who did not submit papers . non - presenters wishing to attend the workshop should submit a one page description of their current research interests and their relation to the workshop themes . research descriptions should be emailed to prevost @ pal . xerox . com no later than september 14 , 1998 . the list of attendees will be finalized by september 18 . workshop organizers joseph w . sullivan , fx palo alto lab , usa ( sullivan @ pal . xerox . com ) justine cassell , mit media laboratory , usa ( justine @ media . mit . edu ) workshop program committee committee co - chairs : scott prevost , fx palo alto lab , usa ( prevost @ pal . xerox . com ) elizabeth churchill , fx palo alto lab , usa ( churchill @ pal . xerox . com ) committee members : elisabeth andr , dfki gmbh , germany ( elisabeth . andre @ dfki . de ) gene ball , microsoft research , usa ( geneb @ microsoft . com ) phil cohen , oregon graduate institute , usa ( pcohen @ cse . ogi . edu ) barbara hayes - roth , stanford univ . , usa ( hayes-roth @ cs . stanford . edu ) kenji mase , atr international , japan ( mase @ mic . atr . co . jp ) clifford nass , stanford university , usa ( nass @ leland . stanford . edu ) mark steedman , university of pennsylvania , usa ( steedman @ cis . upenn . edu ) kris thorisson , lego a / s , denmark ( kris @ digi . lego . com ) demos chair : timothy bickmore , isii inc . , usa ( bickmore @ pal . xerox . com ) additional information for more information , please consult the workshop web page : www . fxpal . com / wecc98 /

0,"semantics / syntax - semantics interface / language acquisition van hout , angeliek ; event semantics of verb frame alternations : a case study of dutch and its acquisition ; 0-8153 - 3128 - 2 , cloth ; pages , $ 91 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics using both theoretical and language acquisition arguments , this study proposes a new model of the lexicon-syntax interface defined in terms of checking event-semantic features . the research is based on dutch verbs and their possible verb frames ( intransitive , transitive , etc . ) and two studies of children 's dutch . the model developed from these cases represents more generally the way in which universal grammar organizes the lexicon of a language and the mapping system that associates a verb 's lexical features with its syntactic projection . the author shows that a predicate 's event-semantic or aspectual properties define the mapping relation between lexicon and syntax , rather than lexical-semantic information of the verb 's event participants , which is the more traditional view . a verb 's appearance in several different verb frames is determined by event type-shifting ; an atelic ( = unbounded ) or a telic ( = bounded ) event type yields different verb frames , and so does a non-causative or a causative event type . these effects can only be captured if the mapping relation is sensitive to event semantics . the two acquisition studies offer a new and unique perspective on verb learning . one is a longitudinal study on the acquisition of light verbs ; the other is an experimental study on the acquisition of intransitive verbs . they show that children are sensitive to event semantics from early in the language acquisition process . e - mail : info @ garland . com

0,"new book : language processes social and cognitive approaches to interpersonal communication edited by susan r . fussell , carnegie mellon university roger j . kreuz , university of memphis historically , the social aspects of language use have been considered the domain of social psychology , while the underlying psycholinguistic mechanisms have been the purview of cognitive psychology . recently , however , it has become increasingly clear that these two dimensions are highly interrelated : cognitive mechanisms underlying speech production and comprehension interact with social psychological factors , such as beliefs about one 's interlocutors and politeness norms , and with the dynamics of the conversation itself , to produce shared meaning . this realization has led to an exciting body of research integrating the social and cognitive dimensions which has greatly increased our understanding of human language use . this volume contains a collection of papers by noted social and cognitive psychologists illustrating this theme . each chapter demonstrates how the theoretical approaches and research methods of social and cognitive psychology can be successfully interwoven to provide insight into one or more fundamental questions about the process of interpersonal communication . the topics under investigation include the nature and role of speaker intentions in the communicative process , the production and comprehension of indirect speech and figurative language , perspective-taking and conversational collaboration , and the relationships between language , cognition , culture , and social interaction . the book will be of interest to all those who study interpersonal language use : social and cognitive psychologists , theoretical and applied linguists , and communication researchers . 0-8058 - 2269 - 0 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 59 . 95 0-8058 - 2270 - 4 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 32 . 50 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com

"" while such a wording sounds rather modest , the actual implementation in his book , if viewed within the framework of his time , might very appropriately be called revolutionary . he broke with august schleicher 's distinction between 'd evelopment ' ( in prehistorical time ) and 'd ecay ' ( in historical time ) in the history of language and replaced it with his notion of continuous , uninterrupted development . his survey of the relevant literature of his time is almost exhaustive , and his findings serve as the solid stepping stone for his own advances . to facilitate reading , the editor has supplied an index of names ( with life dates ) , a complete listing of the literature referred to by scherer as well as an introduction to scherer 's life and his general scholarly achievements . towards a history of the basque language jose ignacio hualde , joseba a . lakarra & r . l . trask ( eds . ) 1995 365 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 131 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 585 0 price : us $ 90 . 00 rest of world : cloth : 90 272 3634 8 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com questions related to the origin and history of the basque language spark considerable interest , since it is the only surviving pre - indo - european language in western europe . however , until now , there was no readily available source in english providing answers to these questions or giving an overview of past and current research in this area . this book is intended to partly fill this void . the book contains both state-of - the-art papers which summarize our knowledge about particular areas of basque historical linguistics , and articles presenting new hypotheses and points of view based on hard evidence and careful analysis . all contributors to this volume have demonstrated expertise in the topic within basque historical linguistics that their chapter addresses . two classical articles by the late luis michelena are included in english translation . in addition , the book includes studies on diachronic phonology , morphology and syntax . the relation of basque to other languages is also investigated in a couple of chapters . english historical linguistics 1994 . papers from the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics ( 8 icehl , edinburgh , 19-23 september 1994 ) 1996 viii , 403 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 135 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 590 7 price : us $ 84 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 3639 9 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this volume offers a selection of 19 papers from those read at the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics . the topics discussed span the whole history of english from the common germanic period to the present century . the book also includes , as appropriate to the conference venue , a number of papers on the aspects of the historical development of scots and scottish english . historical pragmatics . pragmatic developments in the history of english andreas h . jucker ( ed . ) 1995 xvi , 624 pp . pragmatics & beyond new series , 35 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 328 9 price : us $ 97 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 5047 2 price : hfl . 170 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com until very recently , pragmatics has been restricted to the analysis of contemporary spoken language while historical linguistics has studied historical texts and language change in a decontextualized way . this has now radically changed and scholars from around the world are trying to build a new theoretical framework that integrates recent advances both in pragmatics and in historical linguistics . this volume , which contains 22 original titles , starts with an introduction that is both a state-of - the-art account of historical pragmatics and a programmatic statement of its future potential and its different subfields . part i contains seven pragmaphilological papers that deal with historical texts and their interpretations by paying close attention to the communicative context of these texts . the second and third parts comprise papers in diachronic pragmatics . the ten papers of part ii take a linguistic form as their starting point , e . g . particular lexical items or syntactic constructions , and study their pragmatic functions at different times ( diachronic form-to - function mappings ) , while the four papers of part iii take a particular pragmatic function as their starting point . e . g . discourse strategies or politeness , and study their linguistic realisation at different times ( diachronic function-to - form mappings ) . contributions by : c . allen ;

0,"phonology / phonetics casali , roderic f . ; resolving hiatus ; 0-8153 - 3149 - 5 , cloth ; pages , $ 59 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study investigates two alternative ways in which languages resolve sequences of adjacent vowels ( hiatus ) : deletion of one of the vowels , or coalescence of the adjacent vowels to form a third vowel that combines features of both the originals . although existing phonological theories predict relatively few restrictions on the behavior of either process , a survey of 92 languages reveals a number of surprising and previously unreported limitations on their behavior . for example , although deletion of the first of two vowels is extremely common and can apply in any position , deletion of the second vowel is restricted to certain well-defined morpho-syntactic contexts , such as the boundary between a root and a suffix . these restrictions , are explained in terms of functionally-motivated constraints that favor preservation of phonological material in certain prominent positions , such as in root morphemes . in the case of coalescence , the study reveals a surprising correlation between the structure of a language 's vowel inventory and the result of merging high and a non-high vowels . this correlation is explained in terms of a novel theory of acoustic height features whose detailed specification is determined by functionally-motivated constraints sensitive to the number of vowel heights within a particular language . e - mail : info @ garland . com

0,"tanlps workshop : final call for paper tanlps workshop : final call for papers held at the european conference on machine learning ( ecml ' 98 ) , chemnitz , germany 21-24 april 1998 ( www address : http : / / www . tu-chemnitz . de / informatik / ecml98 / ) . tanlps towards adaptive nlp - driven systems : linguistic information , learning methods and applications 24 april 1998 organized by : r . basili , m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) since most of its applications , from syntactic to semantic , are lexicon driven , systematic and reliable acquisition on a large scale of linguistic information is the real challenge to natural language processing ( nlp ) . empiricist view on natural language processing and learning has become recently more attractive for a wider research community : computational linguistics , artificial intelligence , psychology then seemed to converge on a specific data-oriented perspective aiming to overcome the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck . it has been often noted that the limited attention paid by the machine learning community to text and speech data seems unjustified . it is thus more and more evident that empirical learning of natural language processing ( nlp ) can alleviate the nlp main problem by means of a variety of methods for the automatic induction of lexical knowledge . lexical knowledge is often hard to compile by hand , and even harder to port and reuse . nlp application systems still have a low impact on real world problems , mainly due to the costs related to reusability and customization of the required lexicons . in particular , changes in the domain causes changes in the lexical information required in the underlying natural language . empirical , symbolic machine learning methods can be perfectly suited for this task like automatic acquisition and adaptation of this knowledge . rule induction , symbolic approaches to clustering , lazy learning , and inductive logic programming , have been already proposed by a growing community that is entering the challenge for theoretical ( i . e . methodological ) and application purposes a variety of techniques seems to be combined in order to successfully design realistic inductive systems for text processing : the target of this research is to define methods and design principles for systems combining linguistic and lexical learning capabilities for large scale language processing tasks . this is what we mean with adaptive nlp - driven systems . within this research task , some issues can favour a synergistic process between nlp and ml areas : the access to large data sets , that are even increasing over time , due to the telematics facilities available nowadays ; extending the set of typical classes of ml problems to other hard cases ( particularly dense in the nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities to nlp system for tasks related to specific applications ( i . e . information extraction ) . the proposed workshop thus aims at stimulating reasearch and discussion on the following aspects : - establishing results and evidencies on the suitability of different ml paradigms on specific levels of representation of lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison of the quantitative approaches to lexical acquisition with empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion on cognitive perspective of some models within a plausible architecture for language processing and learning - establishing results on the applicability of the extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , with respect to assessed evaluation criteria , typical of the ml and language engineering ( le ) area - case studies on adaptive nlp systems , i . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences with inductive capabilities ( www kb at cmu , ecran , . . . ) , - critical review of existing experiences on adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines for an evaluation framework of adaptive nlp systems : accuracy of the linguistic process , robustness of the induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups in europe and usa to exchange ideas , data and tools for design and experiment architectures for adaptive nlp systems related events a parallel workshop will be also held in the ecml conference : "" text mining "" organized by yves kodratoff . although close in intent and topics , the two workshops have a specific "" identity "" in terms of area of research , multidisciplinary aspects and contributions . so , in order to enhance the discussion and the synergistic contributions to the two independent approaches , submissions covering common problems ( i . e . adaptive data mining from textual data ) will undergo a specific review , in cooperation with the other workshop pc . in fact , a joint ( half day ) session on specific borderline topics as well as on existing ( hybrid ) systems has been planned and a subset of the accepted papers will be presented there . a particular effort will be asked to authors for stressing / enhancing synergistic aspects . the program committee will suggest guidelines to compare / generalize / extend individual contributions in this specific perspective . workshop format : the workshop is expected to cover the whole day . in the first session , apart from an invited talk , we expect to cover methodological issues . papers related to advanced research on suitability of learning paradigms for the different target lexical information will be favoured . prototypical examples in this area are studies on empirical learning of tasks like pos tagging , induction of grammatical information , symbolic learning of word sense disambiguation criteria and lexical semantic information . a panel discussion is expected to close the morning session and focus on principles of suitability for learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . in the second session we expect to stimulate participants to cover application areas , like ir and ie , on original research works that are currently under development in several research centres in europe ( sheffield , tilburg , rome tor vergata and torino universities ) . a panel discussion on the implication of the adaptive paradigm on existing and potential nlp systems will close the workshop . program committee r . basili ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university of tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university of torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university of sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers should not exceed 3000 words or 6 pages . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained postscript or rtf formats , to basili @ info . utovrm . it for each submission -

0,"new book : cognitive linguistics the new psychology of language cognitive and functional approaches to language structure edited by michael tomasello , emory university the history of psychological approaches to the study of language has included periods of little communication between the disciplines of linguistics and psychology , and periods where each field drew upon the theories and methods of the other in limited - - and often limiting - - ways . this book represents a new approach that may define the next era in the relationship between psychology and linguistics . it does so by presenting the evolving linguistic theories collectively known as cognitive - functional linguistics in terms that are intended to be accessible to cognitive scientists interested in how language works psychologically . in contrast to the chomskian linguistic theories with which most psychologists today are familiar , the cognitive-functional approach of these linguists focuses on the things people communicate about ( communicative functions ) and the social conventions by means of which they do so ( linguistic symbols and structures ) . the chapters in this book were all written by linguists who are leading proponents of this approach and edited by a psychologist committed to bringing this new way of looking at language into the mainstream of psychology . the volume promises to give psychologists a new appreciation of what this variety of linguistics can offer their study of language and communication , as well as to provide cognitive-functional linguists new models for presenting their work to audiences outside the boundaries of traditional linguistics . 0-8058 - 2576 - 2 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 65 . 00 0-8058 - 2577 - 0 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 29 . 95 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com

0,"contrastive linguistics and translation - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - call for papers and participation symposium contrastive linguistics and translation studies empirical approaches universit catholique de louvain louvain - la - neuve , belgium 5 - 6 february , 1999 introduction over the last few years an important change has taken place in research into contrastive linguistics and translation studies . whereas previously both fields have drawn on largely introspective methodologies , most research is now conducted on large bodies of bilingual or multilingual data , a change which has had the important effect of providing the two disciplines with a much more solid empirical basis . many researchers are now working with computerised data , in many cases using specifically designed linguistic software tools to conduct automatic or semi-automatic analyses . bilingual concordancers are a case in point . research projects along these lines are becoming more widespread throughout the academic community and initial results are highly encouraging , revealing the enormous potential of computerised corpus analyses both for contrastive linguistics and translation studies . of course many researchers are still opting to use purely manual methods of analysis : indeed for many types of linguistic analysis ( semantic or discourse analysis for example ) , they will remain the only option for the foreseeable future . it is also notable that there are very few bilingual computer corpora available . for many therefore , the use of manual methods may not be a question of choice . this symposium is intended to bring together specialists in the fields of contrastive linguistics and translation studies conducting research on bilingual or multilingual corpora of any type . one important objective will be to demonstrate to what extent detailed corpus analysis can support , contradict or refine introspective contrastive analyses . another key aim is to examine the strengths and weaknesses of manual and automatic methods of data analysis . and lastly , the meeting will provide a valuable opportunity to exchange and share data , a step on the way to setting up an international multilingual databank available to everyone working in the field . symposium topics below is a non-exhaustive list of subject areas which we hope to address during the symposium : - contrastive lexicology ( in particular , contrastive phraseology ) - bilingual / multilingual lexicography - contrastive semantics - contrastive syntax - contrastive pragmatics - compiling and exploiting bilingual / multilingual computerised corpora - software tools for the analysis of bilingual corpora ( bilingual concordancing , automatic alignment , multilingual part-of - speech tagging , etc . ) - bilingual corpora and automatic / computer-aided translation languages english and french will be the two official symposium languages , with most papers given in english . symposium venue the symposium will take place in louvain - la - neuve , an entirely pedestrian university campus which , with its cafes , restaurants , shops , sports centre , cinema and theatre , offers all the advantages of a real town . 20 minutes away from brussels , it is easy to reach by car , train and plane , brussels national airport being within very easy reach . deadline for abstracts anyone wishing to present a paper at the symposium should send a one page abstract in electronic format ( preferably a word attachment ) to sylviane granger ( address below ) by 16 october 1998 at the latest . notification of acceptance will be given by 6 november 1998 . payment the cost of the symposium is as follows : - before 30 november 1998 : 2500 belgian francs - after 30 november 1998 : 3500 belgian francs this includes the symposium fee , the book of abstracts , coffee breaks and lunch on both days . accommodation two types of accommodation are on offer : - chambre la rsidence universitaire ( le relais , rue de la gare 6 , 1348 louvain - la - neuve ) : 1600 fb par nuit , petit djeuner inclus ;

0,"syntax runner , jeffrey t . ; noun phrase licensing ; 0-8153 - 3134 - 7 , cloth ; pages , $ 62 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this book examines the syntax of direct object noun phrases in english within the principles and parameters , specifically chomsky 's minimalist program , approach to generative grammar . the main focus is on the phrase structural positions of object noun phrases at the various levels of representation , and secondarily on the relationship between structural position and semantic interpretation . supported by a variety of empirical and conceptual arguments , the central claim of the book is that direct object noun phrases in english surface in a vp - external position ; a secondary claim is that while in the overt syntax direct objects appear vp - externally , their position at the level of "" logical form "" varies depending on interpretation . four basic constructions are studied : simple transitive clauses , transitive clauses with prepositional objects , the "" raising to object "" construction , and the "" double object "" construction . the particular mismatches observed between overt and covert syntax are argued to follow from a non-movement - based mapping among levels of representation ; specifically the author employs and further develops the "" copy and delete "" approach to movement which , combined with general principles regulating the licensing of phrases at various levels of representation , accounts for the observed mismatches , as well as neatly extending to two further constructions : the existential and stylistic inversion constructions . this book will be of interest to scholars in the areas of phrase structure syntax , english and germanic syntax , the syntax-semantics interface , and all areas of generative approaches to syntax . e - mail : info @ garland . com

0,"towards culturally situated agents * * * call for papers and participation * * * issues in cross cultural communication "" towards culturally situated agents "" http : / / www . nttmsc . com . my / kido / pricai98cfp . html 24th of november 1998 , singapore introduction culture underlies every aspect of social behavior and influences communication style , personality , character , motivation , knowledge and cognition . there is an extensive body of work on cross-cultural differences in communication styles in the linguistics and cultural anthropology literature . in the intelligent user interface design community , over the years , fueled by the recognition that different types of users are motivated by different needs and goals , attention has been given to the development of adaptive user interfaces . however , this line of research and development has given little consideration to the influence that culture plays in shaping what users want out of the computational experience . in order to create interfaces that accommodate different user styles , therefore , it is important to understand these cultural influences , since , in many cases , a user will react to interfaces on the basis of cultural background . similarly , if we are to view an agent , software or robot as a social member of a "" cyber society , "" then that agent must be able to invoke cultural knowledge in order to communicate flexibly with human users and possibly other agents . if agents are reflective only of their designers ' communicative behaviors and are not able to adapt to the styles of other agents which they meet in heterogeneous , distributed environments and virtual reality worlds , then our agents may be trapped in a tower of babel . the goal of this workshop is to discuss cultural influences as they ( may ) inform interactions among human and software agents . this workshop is intended to attract participants from those communities concerned with such a perspective of communication . topics of interest the workshop aims to be interdisciplinary in nature and is therefore open to contributions from various research fields . the topics which the workshop addresses are relevant , for instance , in : anthropology , sociology , sociolinguistics , human computer interaction ( hci ) , cscw , machine learning , adaptive systems research , collaborative virtual environments , multi-media multi-user environments , ethnology , social sciences , psychology and cognitive science . the scope of this workshop includes , but need not be restricted to the following topics : * the nature of cross cultural communication , including case studies and examples * the origin and evolution of communication * linguistic and ethnographic studies of cross cultural communication * negotiation strategies among humans from different cultural backgrounds * negotiation strategies among agents informed by different cultural principles * user interfaces and new media for cross cultural communication * the impact of internet technology on cross cultural communication * culturally situated metaphors in interface , machine and agent design * ethnomethodology in interface and agent design * culturally dependent metaphors and language of describing and talking about humans , machines and agents : influences on the design process , theory / model building , and scientific experimentation * case studies of program execution problems due to agent to agent and human to agent miscommunication * standards which are open to the development of multiple ontologies of mult iagent communication in heterogeneous environments * working examples of culturally adaptive agents in multiagent or human-agent systems papers should address these topics in the context of how they relate to issues in agent design and agent behavior . participation and submission of papers the workshop will comprise a few keynote talks , a panel discussion with participants from different research areas and presentations of preliminary findings by workshop participants . participants will be selected by the organizing committee ( see below ) based on submitted papers . potential participants who wish to present their work at the workshop should submit a short paper ( up to 5 , 000 words ) or extended abstract ( 1 , 500 to 2 , 500 words ) . contributions should describe work in progress , completed work , positions , or give significant insight into the issues on cross cultural communication . other potential participants should send a statement of interest ( one page ) , briefly describing their work and their interest in the workshop . some of the participants will be asked to contribute a paper to the final working notes . all participants will be invited to bring a poster presenting their work . submissions should be sent by e-mail ( ascii , unix compatible postscript , or rtf ) to the workshop chair , takashi kido ,

how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop is organized as a series of discussion sessions , each one devoted to one aspect of computational language , initiated by a report of the discussions at the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada is available ; see below ) . enough time for discussion has been scheduled . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation , of text and speech o automated ( cross-lingual ) information extraction and summarization o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics-based ) o speech recognition and synthesis o multimedia communication , as well as language and speaker identification o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o government policy for future funding the initial findings of the report will form the basis of the discussion . the draft report is now available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / major points raised in the discussions will be recorded and included in the report . we eagerly seek your feedback , comments , contributions , and assistance , to make this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! program 9 : 00 - 9 : 10 welcome and overview 9 : 10 - 9 : 55 cross - lingual and cross - modal information retrieval moderator : judith klavans 9 : 55 - 10 : 40 information extraction and automated text summarization moderator : eduard hovy 10 : 40 - 11 : 00 break 11 : 00 - 11 : 45 methods and techniques moderator : nancy ide 11 : 45 - 12 : 30 machine translation of text and speech moderator : bente maegaard 12 : 30 - 2 : 00 lunch 2 : 00 - 2 : 45 multilingual resources moderator : martha palmer 2 : 45 - 3 : 30 speech recognition and synthesis moderator : tba 3 : 30 - 4 : 00 break 4 : 00 - 4 : 45 evaluation and assessment moderator : john white 4 : 45 - 5 : 30 multimedia communication and language / speaker identification moderator : oliviero stock 5 : 30 - 6 : 00 government : development policy and funding moderator : antonio zampolli the report the outcome of the granada and montreal workshops is a report , originally commissioned by the nsf , to be submitted to the nsf , le , and other funding agencies in europe and north america . the first draft of the report is available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / we eagerly seek your feedback , comments , contributions , and assistance in making this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! organizers robert frederking center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : + 1-412 - 268-6656 fax : + 1-412 - 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu eduard hovy information sciences institute of the university of southern california 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : + 1-310 - 822-1511 fax : + 1-310 - 823-6714 email : hovy @ isi . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , ny 12604-0520 usa tel : + 1-914 - 437 5988 fax : + 1-914 - 437 7498 email : ide @ cs . vassar . edu joseph mariani limsi-cnrs bp 133 91403 orsay cedex france tel : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8085 fax : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8088 email : mariani @ limsi . fr antonio zampolli ilc-cnr via della faggiola 32 56100 pisa italy fax : + 39-50 - 556285 email : pisa @ ilc . pi . cnr . it - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - eduard hovy email : hovy @ isi . edu usc information sciences institute tel : 310-822 - 1511 ext 731 4676 admiralty way fax : 310-823 - 6714 marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 project homepage : http : / / www . isi . edu / natural-language / nlp-at - isi . html

0,"new uci dissertation in linguistics irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following uci dissertation in linguistics . overt movement as a reflex of morphology hajime ikawa under the framework of the minimalist program , this thesis answers fundamental questions with overt movement such as ( i ) what forces its application , and ( ii ) what is responsible for its presence / absence in languages . chapter 1 raises the above-mentioned fundamental questions with overt movement . it is shown that the current minimalist framework , as it is , does not explain any of them in a principled way . chapter 2 introduces two major operations assumed by the minimalist program , merge and move . chapter 3 first undertakes to identify the cause of overt movement in a way consistent with the basic minimalist assumption that any application of overt movement , as a departure from the best case , should be forced from the outside of the core computational system . it is claimed that overt movement is directly driven by the module morphology , which applies right after spell - out ; overt movement , whether head-movement or xp - movement , is forced to apply to morphologically support the suffixal functional heads . this claim automatically leads to derive the absence of overt movement in consistently head-final languages like japanese from their word order . the proposed analysis not only provides principled answers for the fundamental questions with overt movement , but eliminates one of the most problematic aspects of the minimalist program , the strong / weak distinction among functional heads . chapter 4 discusses various implications and consequences of the proposed analysis for overt movement , phrase structure , the computational system , and typological variations . chapter 5 discusses overt np - raising as overt movement indirectly driven by the morphological properties of agr . it is claimed that a subject in nominative-accusative languages overtly raises not to directly support agr , but to provide f-features for agr so that it can be successfully suffixed to a verb as the overt realization of the f-features of an np . from this , asymmetries between overt np - raising and other overt movements directly driven by morphology naturally follow . also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : "" partial "" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the "" crossing "" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : object shift as short scrambling kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 5 ;

"" the author shows that a proper understanding of the properties of p-movement can be attained within the framework of the minimalist program . maria luisa zubizarreta is associate professor at the university of southern california . linguistic inquiry monograph 33 august 1998 6 x 9 , 232 pp . , 4 illus . paper isbn 0-262 - 74021 - 4 cloth isbn 0-262 - 24041 - 6 jud wolfskill associate publicist phone : ( 617 ) 253-2079 mit press fax : ( 617 ) 253-1709 five cambridge center e - mail : wolfskil @ mit . edu cambridge , ma 02142-1493 http : / / mitpress . mit . edu

0,"language as metaphor & metaphors for language - - session at aaa 98 i have volunteered to organize the following session for the next meeting of the society for linguistic anthropology at aaa 98 ( next winter in washington ) : language as metaphor and metaphors for language metaphor has been shown to be an integral component of the way we conceptualize experience and embody it in language . but metaphor can also be thought of as a specific tool that can be used in a variety of disciplines : a concrete image can summarize or illuminate the object of study , and sometimes even inform the direction of the discipline . new theories give rise to new metaphors , and the study of such metaphors can throw light on the development of theories . papers are invited from both linguists and non-linguists on two topics : 1 ) language used as metaphor : for a restricted communicative code used concurrently with language : e . g . the language of flowers ; but also for various characteristics of expressive or cognitive domains , e . g . the grammar / syntax / vocabulary of architecture , music , etc . ; what characteristics of language are used metaphorically ? to what do they correspond in other domains ? what is the usefulness of language metaphors for the domains in question ? 2 ) language as object of metaphor : what can language be compared to ? explicit ( e . g . neo-grammarian ' family tree ' ; saussure 's game of chess ; the city ) and implicit ( ? ) metaphors for language ; what do such metaphors reveal about language and how speakers view it ? how do metaphors for language relate to directions in linguistics ? please contact me : marie - lucie tarpent , mount st vincent u , halifax , n . s . b3m 2j6 canada ; 902-457 - 6172 ; marie-lucie . tarpent @ msvu . ca .

0,"workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change newsletter 1 . workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . 8 september 1998 , paris , france . in colaboration with the cnrs ( centre national de recherche scientifique ) , the lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) is organizing some workshops to create a forum to encourage the discussion between researchers in linguistics from the netherlands and france . one of the workshops is initiated by members of the university of amsterdam and has as its subject : complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . the workshop will take place on tuesday the 8th of september , starting at 14 . 30 until approximately 20 . 00h . the theme although there is a kind of dogma that all natural languages are equally complex , at least for certain subsystems of language there may well be differences in complexity . in discussions of processes of language change and first and second language acquisition the notion of complexity plays an important role . especially in creole studies simplicity and complexity implicitly have been dominant issues in the debate , but are seldom properly scrutinized . in this workshop we want to discuss the role of complexity in these domains , including grammatical theory , first and second language acquisition , language change and language contact - in order to shed light on controversial problems invoked by the term complexity in linguistics in general . the structure of the workshop the workshop is organized around three themes : creole languages , language acquisition and language change . each theme will be discussed by researchers from france and the netherlands in 10 minutes presentations , inspired by the following propositions . after these short presentations there will be time for discussion in each session . 1 . all languages have the same "" costs / payment "" balance , i . e . if a language becomes phonologically more simple , its morphological system will become more complex . [ cf . haugen 1976 : 286 ] 2 . all complexity in languages resides in the lexicon . [ cf . aronoff 1995 ] 3 . languages spoken within small communities are more complex than languages of large communities . [ cf . whinnom 1980 , hymes 1971 , mhlhusler 1996 ] 4 . language shift will in general lead to simplification , while borrowing will lead generally to more complex structures .

0,"new books on human cognitive processing john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new title in the field of human cognitive processing : the contemporary theory of metaphor a perspective from chinese < br > ning yu the primary objective of this book is to contribute to the contemporary theory of metaphor from the viewpoint of chinese so as to help place the theory into a wider cross-linguistic and cross-cultural perspective . aiming at this primary objective , it explores two major questions faced by the contemporary theory : ( 1 ) if abstract reasoning is at least partially metaphorical in nature ; and ( 2 ) what conceptual metaphors are universal , widespread , or culture-specific . it focuses on ( 1 ) metaphors of emotions , ( 2 ) the time as space metaphor , and ( 3 ) the event structure metaphor . it studies how chinese is similar to and different from english with regard to these metaphor systems and image schemas involved , and what reasons ( cognitive or cultural ) can account for the similarities and differences between these two languages . in general , the empirical studies presented in this book reinforce the view that metaphor is the main mechanism through which abstract concepts are comprehended and abstract reasoning is performed . they also support , from the perspective of chinese , the candidacy of some conceptual metaphors for metaphorical universals . these include , for instance , the anger is heat metaphor , the happy is up metaphor , the time as space metaphor and the event structure metaphor . it seems that these conceptual metaphors are grounded in some basic human experiences that may be universal to all human beings . 1998 ca 300pp . human cognitive processing , 1 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 201 0 price : usd 59 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 2353 x price : nlg 118 bernadette martinez - keck publicity / marketing tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com john benjamins north america po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /

0,"errors in language learning . james , carl . ( 1998 ) . errors in language learning and use : exploring error analysis . london : longman . isbn 0 582 25763 - 8 ( paperback ) . rrp : 14 . 99 . the analysis of errors in cognitive , linguistic and other psychological processes has a long history dating back to the introduction of signal detection theory in psychophysics and behavioural learning paradigms . although many applied linguists now favour interlanguage paradigms for second-language acquisition , error analysis ( ea ) is still widely used in language classes . the attraction of ea lies in one 's ability to isolate variability in responses , such as distinguishing true errors from "" mistakes "" , which simple "" correct / incorrect "" paradigms tend to discard . in this new book on ea in language learning and usage , carl james builds on his earlier work on contrastive analysis and applied linguistics to further explore the role that performance errors play in language acquisition ( particularly second-language acquisition ) . the book consists of a historical overview of ea in applied linguistics , and then embarks on an ambitious attempt to both define and constrain the scope and methodology of ea in language processing and language learning . this methodology includes typologies for classifying and understanding how errors arise , as well as algorithmic specifications for the diagnosis and error correction in clinical and educational settings . the first chapter aims to give a historical overview of ea in the context of its origins , its inspirations , its competitors , and its influences on second language teaching . james defines an error as "" an unsuccessful bit of language "" ( p . 1 ) which seems to be as succinct and compact a description as i ' ve ever read ! however , this very readable style of writing , whilst appearing informal , is maintained through later chapters where discussion of technical issues could easily have been obfuscated by a poor writing style . first - and second-order paradigms within language learning are described in detail in this chapter , with the interlanguage and crosslinguistic approaches compared with alternatives such as ea and contrastive analysis . idiosyncratic and language-specific difficulties in language learnability are also covered in the context of linguistic change and metalinguistic influences on successful language acquisition . several methods for collecting data in ea are informally introduced in this chapter ( e . g . , error elicitations such as the "" broad trawl "" ) , which naturally leads into the second chapter on defining the scope of ea in language acquisition . the second chapter begins with an enlightening discussion of popular conceptions of what "" proper "" language is ( such as the king 's english ) , and catalogues the many failed attempts to enforce a "" correct "" dialect of english both in britain and asia ( the "" complaints "" tradition ) . this issue is clearly relevant for defining exactly what an error is , given the absolutist attributions made by some educators and policy makers about the tenability or correctness of certain forms of spoken and written english ( i . e . , "" standard "" english ) . james outlines some typologies for understanding language norms based on geographical and historical constraints , but correctly identifies deficiencies in these schemes ( particularly the failure , for example , to understand the role of colonialism in language preferences ) . this issue is taken up with respect to the issue of power and authority of native speakers with respect to non-native speakers of english , and conversely how the desire to speak a second language can unwittingly result in language loss and native - language change . chapters 3 , 4 and 5 focus on the definition and description of errors within the ea paradigm , having defined the focus of the ea methodology in the previous chapters . james begins by defining learners ' ignorance of a target language in terms of four categories of deviance : grammaticality , acceptability , correctness and strangeness . it is a clear advantage of the authors ' approach to ea that both grammatical / rational and performance / empirical approaches to language acquisition are covered by his typology , thus not "" taking sides "" with one viewpoint or the other . this rationale is based on the idea that ea is a methodology rather than a theoretical prescription . this focus continues with a discussion of error detection methods , in the context of locating and describing such errors in different parts of speech and indeed with respect to discourses longer than single sentences or phrases . the importance of a pluralistic approach which is tolerant of differences in dialects is emphasised , whilst ensuring that objective and stationary criteria are applied to utterances and writing within each dialect group . error taxonomies , such as feature and surface structure approaches , are outlined in detail with worked examples , which are one of the key design features of the authors ' pedagogical approach . computer - assisted analysis of errors is also discussed , as are specific algorithmic approaches to rating levels of error in lexical and grammatical processes . the next two chapters focus on diagnosing errors and evaluating their seriousness and impact for second-language learners in particular . possible negative influences , such as interlingual errors arising from conflicts between the target language and mother tongue , are treated in detail , as are intralingual errors and inconsistencies which the non-native speaker encounters for the first time in the target language , such as over-generalisations and false analogies . in addition , the role of culture in influencing and perhaps determining some aspects of linguistic behaviour is discussed , for example , how native speakers might "" gate "" a non-native speaker . error gravity and comprehensibility are also covered , as are some amusing examples given for "" the irritation factor "" . the sociopragmatic consequences of error production in social situations , and the potentially negative outcomes for non-native speakers , are also discussed . chapter 8 discusses pragmatic strategies for using ea to correct errors in speech and writing for second language learners . these are enhanced by a number of case studies presented in chapter 9 . the issues covered in these last two chapters are non-trivial for applied linguistics : is second - language teaching effective ? if so , which approaches are best suited to particular kinds of students ? are formal / grammatical or informal / conversational approaches superior ? although james provides no magic answers for any of these questions , he does present a coherent methodology for answering these kinds of questions for individual situations , which is the great appeal of this book . this book would be suitable as an undergraduate or graduate text in applied linguistics or tesl programmes , but will be an invaluable reference for researchers in related fields such as psycholinguistics and machine translation , who might be searching for a more formal methodology for understanding error production in their respective fields . this book will be an indispensable addition to every linguist 's library . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

"" - - deborah tannen , georgetown university a study that will appeal to any reader interested in the relationship between our language and our laws , ideology in the language of judges focuses on the way judges take guilty pleas from criminal defendants and on the judges ' views of their own courtroom behavior . this book argues that variation in the discourse structure of the guilty pleas can best be understood as enactments of the judges ' differing interpretations of due process law and the proper role of the judge in the courtroom . susan philips demonstrates how legal and professional ideologies are expressed differently in interviews and socially occurring speech , and reveals how bounded written and spoken genres of legal discourse play a role in containing and ordering ideological diversity in language use . she also shows how the ideological struggles in a given courtroom are central yet largely hidden or denied . such findings will contribute significantly to the study of how speakers create realities through their use of language . april 1998 224 pp . 0-19 - 511341 - 1 paper $ 29 . 95 0-19 - 511340 - 3 cloth $ 59 . 00 oxford university press on reconstructing grammar : comparative cariban morphosyntax spike gildea , rice university ( oxford studies in anthropological linguistics 18 ) this book has two important aims . the first is to argue that grammaticalization theory has advanced to the point where it can be used with the comparative method to reconstruct the grammar of proto - languages . the second is to give a detailed case-study of this methodology by examining the typologically interesting cariban language family of south america - - a language group that has , according to most linguists , an impossible ( that is , far too technical ) syntactic structure . spike gildea 's findings answer long-standing questions about the historical reconstruction of grammar and will interest linguists concerned with south american languages and with grammaticalization , as well as those working in the descriptive or functional traditions . september 1998 304 pp . ; 15 linecuts 0-19 - 510952 - x $ 85 . 00 oxford university press _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for more information about linguistics titles from oxford : visit the oxford university press usa web site at http : / / www . oup-usa . org or e-mail : linguistics @ oup-usa . org

0,"new book : atomism and binding atomism and binding edited by hans bennis , pierre pica and johan rooryck the state of the art in binding : everything on reference , coreference , nonreference and disjoint reference , and more on boundedness and freedom . the sixteen papers in this new volume provide a representative overview of the broad range of issues relevant to the study of binding phenomena in the generative framework . since the inception of the theoretical interest in co-referential relations in generative grammar , there has been a debate with respect to the question as to whether and how ( co ) - reference should be represented in the grammar . notions such as "" ( co ) - indexation "" , "" disjoint reference "" , "" free "" and "" bound "" play an important role in this discussion . their relevance is explicitly analyzed in many articles of this volume . the role of thematic information in binding theory constitutes another important line of inquiry elaborated on in this book . various contributors to this volume argue that thematic information largely influences binding phenomena , although the specific proposals expressing this relation differ quite substantially . another issue pursued here is related to the discussion whether binding theory is a component of sentence grammar . many papers address this issue quite explicitly and delineate the respective roles of sentence and discourse grammar in novel and intriguing ways . the volume contains the following contributions : stephen berman & arild hestvik : "" split antecedents , noncoreference and drt "" ; george aaron broadwell : "" binding theory and switch-reference "" ; hamida demirdache : "" condition c "" ; robert fiengo & robert may : "" the semantic significance of syntactic identity "" ; zygmunt frajzyngier : "" pronouns and agreement : systems interaction in the coding of reference "" ; robert freidin : "" binding theory on minimalist assumptions "" ; jeff gruber : "" a configurational approach to thematic binding "" ; james higginbotham : "" a plea for implicit anaphors "" ; hajime hoji : "" sloppy identity and principle b "" ; jan koster : "" anaphora and the uniformity of grammar "" ; howard lasnik : "" levels of representation and the elements of anaphora "" ; seth minkoff : "" on the syntax of local and logophoric control "" ; gertjan postma : "" logical entailment and the possessive nature of reflexive pronouns "" ; eric reuland & sigridur sigurjonsdottir : "" long distance ' binding ' in icelandic : syntax or discourse ?

0,"call for papers : dgfs meeting 1998 call for papers as part of the annual meeting of the german linguistic society ( deutsche gesellschaft fuer sprachwissenschaft ) , to be held in halle ( saale ) , germany , march 4 / 6 1988 , there will be a workshop ( arbeitsgruppe ) on the following topic : the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication in the last thirty years research on intercultural communication has attracted increasing scientific attention not only as a result of social developments but also due to the growing interdisciplinary cooperation between different disciplines such as cultural anthropology , ethnology , sociology , and linguistics ( c . f . ehlich 1996 ) . a central topic of the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication is determined by the experience that the use of a common language system does not guarantee mutual understanding . therefore , the theoretical conception of intercultural communication ( either in everyday or in institutional situations ) is characterized by misunderstandings ( gumperz ) . analyses of the mediation of intercultural competences show that both contrastive and interactive investigations into intercultural communication are important in order to answer the questions on the contextualizations of speech actions and on their universal or culture specific characteristics . only recently , has the innovative potential of intercultural communication started to attract particular attention ( c . f . koole & ten thije 1994 ) . it has become clear that research into intercultural communication should take an interdisciplinary perspective and requires reflection on traditional linguistic categories of linguistic description in order to see which new discursive forms are facilitated by intercultural communication . the specific question to be adressed in this workshop is whether the linguistic involvement in intercultural research has resulted in the extension and enhancement of new linguistic categories and research methods . reflexion on this issue should focus on topics like procedures of assertaining understanding ( verstdndnissicherung ) ( c . f . metacommunication ) , pragmatic universals ( c . f . politeness ) , contrastive analyses of speech actions and texts , linguistic forms of perspectivity or culture comparison . references ehlich , k .

0,"muc - 7 call for participation * * * call for participation * * * seventh message understanding system evaluation and message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) evaluation : 2 - 6 march 1998 conference : april 1998 washington , d . c . area sponsored by : the human language systems tipster text program of the defense advanced research projects agency information technology office ( darpa / ito ) the message understanding conferences have provided on ongoing forum for assessing the state of the art and practice in text analysis technology and for exchanging information on innovative computational techniques in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks . the evaluations have provided researchers and potential sponsors and customers with a quantitative means to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies , and the results reported on at the conferences have sparked customer interest in the potential utility of the technologies . the seventh message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) will provide an opportunity for both new and experienced muc participants to participate in a flexible evaluation , suited to development needs and abilities . it will provide : * opportunity to select among a variety of tasks : named entity ( ne ) , coreference ( co ) , template element ( te ) , template relationship ( tr ) and scenario template ( st ) . * two tasks for evaluating component technologies ( ne and co ) , which use standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) as output format * redesigned information extraction ( ie ) task , with two domain-independent subtasks ( te and tr ) separated from domain-dependent subtask ( st ) . * emphases of st task on portability and on minimizing human resources required to participate in the evaluation . * three experimental tracks to explore new data sets and tasks . participation in muc - 7 is actively sought from both new and veteran organizations . with the new and redesigned evaluation tasks , muc - 7 offers a good opportunity for organizations to try out new ideas for handling nlp problems that are of both scientific and practical interest without having to participate in the entire range of tasks . the conference itself will consist primarily of presentations and discussions of innovative techniques , system design , and test results . there will also be an opportunity for participants to demo their evaluation systems . attendance at the conference is limited to evaluation participants and to guests invited by the darpa tipster text program . a conference proceedings , including test results , will be published . schedule : 1 july 97 : application deadline for participation 15 july 97 : release of ne , co , te , tr , and example st training data and scorer 8 september 97 : release of dry run st task definition , training data , and scorer 29 sept - 3 oct 97 : muc - 7 dry run ( all participants ) 6 february 98 : release of formal test st task definition , training data , and scorer 2 - 6 march 98 : muc - 7 formal run 7 - 9 april 98 : 7th message understanding conference ( tentative dates ) data and task description : the texts to be used for system development and testing are news service articles from the new york times news service , supplied by the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) [ ldc @ ldc . upenn . edu ] . training , dry run , and test data for all the tasks are extracted from a corpus of approximately 158 , 000 articles . sets of articles to be used in the muc - 7 evaluation will be distributed via ftp upon payment of a one time fee of $ 100 and upon signing of a user agreement for the use of these texts . the user agreement can be retrieved from the ldc catalog ( evaluation agreements ) . the url for the ldc home page is : http : / / www . ldc . upenn . edu . five separate evaluations will be conducted as part of muc - 7 . the definition of these evaluations has been worked out since late 1996 by members of the muc - 7 planning committee . the evaluations may be viewed as capturing the results of text analysis at various levels of aggregation of information : * named entity ( ne ) requires only that the system under evaluation identify each bit of pertinent information in isolation from all others . * coreference ( co ) requires connecting all references to "" identical "" entities . * template element ( te ) requires grouping entity attributes together into entity "" objects . "" * template relationship ( tr ) requires identifying relationships between template elements . * scenario template ( st ) requires identifying instances of a task-specific event and identifying event attributes , including entities that fill some role in the event ; the overall information content is captured via interlinked "" objects . "" * experimental tracks using new data sets are variants of the ne task . the task definition is the same as for the basic ne task , but the texts are different . * experimental track involving a new task is a simplified version of the te task . key things to note about each evaluation task : * ne covers named organizations , people , and locations , along with date / time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions ; it requires production of sgml tags as output . * co covers noun phrases ( common and proper ) and personal pronouns that are "" identical "" in their reference ; it requires production of sgml tags as output ; the tags for coreferring strings form "" equivalance "" classes , which are used for scoring . * te covers organizations , persons , and artifacts , which are captured in the form of template "" objects "" consisting of a predefined set of attributes . * tr covers relationships among template elements , including location and time relationships , which are captured in the form of template "" relations "" consisting of a relationship and the template elements participating in that relationship . tr is a new task for muc - 7 . * st covers a particular scenario , which is kept secret until one month prior to testing in order to focus on system portability ; however , the generalized structure of a scenario template is predefined , and example scenarios are available for participants to examine . this task is domain dependent . * tasks for the experimental tracks are derived from ne and te . there is a world wide web site that allows automated testing following the rules of muc - 6 . it will be of particular value to new participants . the website is password protected and you need to be licensed to access the acl / dci disk from the ldc to obtain a password from chinchor @ gso . saic . com . muc - 6 articles were taken from the acl / dci disk . an anonymous ftp site will be available for downloading muc - 7 related material . this cfp and the muc - 7 participant agreement are available to the public from the ftp site . each participant ( after signing the ldc user agreement and a muc - 7 participation agreement ) will receive a password to download the muc - 7 data , definitions , and scoring software at the release times noted above . the url of the website is http : / / muc . saic . com . the ftp site is ftp . muc . saic . com . test protocol and evaluation criteria : muc - 7 participants may elect to do one or any combination of tasks and experimental tracks . participants will have access to shared resources such as the training texts and annotations / templates , task documentation , and scoring software . all muc - 7 participants are encouraged to participate in the dry run and take advantage of material available . the formal test will be conducted during the first week in march . it will be carried out by the participants at their own sites in accordance with a prepared test procedure and the results submitted to the ftp site for official scoring with the software prepared by saic for muc - 7 . test sets used for the evaluations will consist of 100 texts , with subsets for some of the tasks . there will be different data sets for the dry run and the formal test . systems will be evaluated using recall and precision metrics ( all tasks ) , f - measure ( all tasks ) , and error-based metrics ( all tasks except co ) . the computation of these metrics is based on the scoring categories of correct , partial , incorrect , spurious , missing , and noncommittal . muc - 7 participants will be able to familiarize themselves with the evaluation criteria through usage of the evaluation software , which will be released along with the training data . instructions for responding to the call for participation : organizations within and outside the u . s . are invited to respond to this call for participation . by the time of the actual testing phase of the evaluation , systems must be able to accept texts without manual preprocessing , process them without human intervention , and output annotations ( ne , co ) or templates ( te , tr , st ) in the expected format . organizations should plan on allocating approximately two person-months of effort for participation in the evaluation and conference . it is understood that organizations will vary with respect to experience with sgml text annotation , information extraction , domain expertise / engineering , resources , contractual demands / expectations , etc . recognition of such factors will be made in any analyses of the results . organizations wishing to participate in the evaluation and conference must respond by july 1 , 1997 by submitting a short statement of interest via email and a signed copy of the muc -

0,"semantics yeom , jae - il ; a presuppositional analysis of specific indefinites : common grounds as structured information states ; 0-8153 - 3175 - 4 , cloth ; pages , $ 65 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics a specific indefinite presupposes that someone has in mind an individual who has the property denoted by its descriptive content . having an individual in mind means that the agent knows who the referent is , and thus it affects the information state of the agent , but not the others . the asymmetric information , shared by all participants in a conversation , cannot be represented when the common ground has only one information state . thus a common ground must have multiple information states , each for each participant in a conversation . the information state of the agent who has an individual in mind must be differentiated from the others ' by being structured into sub-information - states so that each sub-information - state associates the specific indefinite with a different unique individual . it then conveys the information that the agent has some individual in mind , but that it is not known yet who it is . this analysis thus requires a new dynamic semantics which is partially representational and partially denotational . this leads to a new analysis of proper names . specific indefinites tend to have widest scope , which is explained by claiming that specific indefinites trigger presuppositions . presuppositions are assumed to have various scopes with respect to operators in a sentence , and the strongest reading is preferred on rational and economic basis . it is shown that stronger readings roughly correspond to wider scopes . this book will be of interest to scholars who work on indefinite nps , presuppositions , anaphora in belief contexts , and dynamic semantics in general . e - mail : info @ garland . com

0,"wolfram and schilling - estes : american english wolfram , walt and schilling - estes , natalie . ( 1998 ) . american english . oxford , u . k . : blackwell . isbn 0-631 - 20846 - 5 ( hardcover ) . rrp : us $ 59 . 95 ( hardcover ) 16 . 99 / us $ 29 . 95 the rich phonology of american "" accents "" is appreciated and instantly identifiable by non - american speakers of english worldwide , through television , radio and now ( perhaps ) through the internet . however , the perceived homogeneity of the american way of speaking as something uniquely "" american "" by these speakers of english , lies in stark contrast to the diversity of american english which is the domestic reality . in this exciting revision of wolfram 's classic "" dialects and american english "" , wolfram and schilling - estes not only attempt to provide a detailed account of the geographical and sociocultural distribution of certain kinds of american english , through distinct dialects , grammar , and usage , but also attempt to dispel a number of urban ( and not-so - urban ) myths common among native american english speakers . the book begins by contrasting the popular definition of "" dialects "" and their relative social desirability ( or otherwise ) , as perceived by native speakers who often feel they do not speak a dialect , with technical definitions from linguistics in the context of the so-called "" desirability-deficit "" debate . the work of schilling - estes in documenting the ocracoke english of north carolina , in particular , places her in a unique position to comment on language variation and the social issues involved in linguistic minorities ( especially in attempting to dispel myths regarding social desirability and dialects ) . the second chapter contrasts linguistic and sociohistorical explanations of the processes by which different dialects arise in languages , and more generally , why languages change over time . whilst the latter explanation sees languages and dialects as arising from the interaction of social and historical conditions , such as migration , settlement , and language contact , the former view sees languages as dynamical systems which have an inherent capacity and impetus to change , which arises from their structure . although some linguists are not directly concerned with sociohistorical factors in language change , the authors successfully integrate both viewpoints by examining general processes such as grammaticalization in the context of specific examples ( such as the new york city vernacular ) . however , those interested solely in a comprehensive review of distinctive american grammar , independent of social factors , should look elsewhere - this book is not a taxonomic ( and nor should it be ) . however , the third chapter which discusses levels of dialect should be useful for understanding the strata of dialects in contemporary american speech . the fourth chapter provides a historical overview of the development of american dialects , from elizabethan influences and pre-revolutionary dialects , to the rise of the west coast and twentieth century accents . this chapter successfully uses geographical diagrams and maps not only to demonstrate localised changes in distinctive dialect features ( such as r-lessness and r-fulness ) that have occurred throughout the history of the united states , but also to demonstrate the flow and influence of dialects during settlement of the interior , and how these changes are related to issues such as language contact and language borrowing from native americans . chapter 5 continues this process by developing examples of regional dialects and variations from many areas of the united states . chapters 6 and 7 develop the idea of dialects beyond regional and geographical differences to encompass dialect change and differences based on social class , ethnicity and gender . these chapters consider key issues such as the patterning of social difference in language in the context of specific examples , such as african american vernacular english ( aave ) . it is interesting to note in this example that even though at least eight distinctive grammatical features distinguish aave from the anglo american dialect , there is variation within each group sufficient to make comparisons difficult for linguists . a more general case is examined with respect to interactions of three or more languages , as is the case in robeson county nc , where native americans constitute 40 % of the county population , where their accent is clearly dominant . chapters 8 and 9 moves away from group analysis of dialects and language to questions of individual language use and style , and the social distribution of these usages . theories of style shifting , such as the attention to speech model , speech accommodation theory and the audience design model are reviewed , and research methods for understanding individual speech acts within paradigms that focus on group-based methods are discussed ( including corpus methods ) . group - exclusive dialect features and dialect patterning are discussed in the context of research methods such as implicational arrays to relate specific grammatical features of different dialects . the book concludes with discussions of the relevance of an understanding of accents and dialects to applied linguistics , an issue which is clearly important historically with the "" desirability-deficit "" debate and in contemporary education of english as a second language . in particular , the use of standardized tests which are based around the recognition of standard english usage and grammar are criticized for being unrealistic ( as well as violating assumptions of content validity ) . one solution might be to use a dialect consistency or achievement measure , and / or developing culturally and linguistically-appropriate testing situations which do not make assumptions about a language learner 's accent and / or social demographics . as the authors recognise , these kinds of aims are very difficult to implement , but certainly recognising the systematic biases in language testing , and encouraging dialect awareness in schools , is a first step . wolfram and schilling - estes explicitly accommodate pedagogical usage of this book , by introducing key concepts in capitals , and including an exercise for students with each new section in the text . at the conclusion of each chapter , there is a very useful "" further reading "" section which will also be useful to students , as will the glossary of common linguistic terms at the end of the book . a skeletal phonetics chart is accompanied by an appendix of socially-diagnostic structures , which will be useful for those working in clinical linguistics . the only criticism which could be levelled at the teaching material in the book is that no solutions are provided for the exercises , so perhaps the development of a separate teacher 's guide ( especially for foreign or tesol instructors ) might be an appropriate future inclusion to this otherwise impressive account of american english . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

[ cf . haugen 1976 : 286 ] 2 . all complexity in languages resides in the lexicon . [ cf . aronoff 1995 ] 3 . languages spoken within small communities are more complex than languages of large communities . [ cf . whinnom 1980 , hymes 1971 , mhlhusler 1996 ] 4 . language shift will in general lead to simplification , while borrowing will lead generally to more complex structures . [ cf . thomason & kaufman 1988 ] 5 . complexity does not play a role in first language acquisition , but it does in second language acquisition . [ cf . trudgill 1992 ] 6 . grammaticalization leads to greater complexity .

0,"syntax nelson , diane carlita ; grammatical case assignment in finnish ; 0-8153 - 3180 - 0 , cloth ; pages , $ 65 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study presents an analysis of patterns of morphological case in finnish within the principles and parameters framework . finnish has a rich system of inflection for both case and agreement , making it an important language for testing hypotheses about the relationships between morphological case and abstract case , and case / case and agreement . the focus of the study is a set of syntactic environments where internal dp arguments appear in nominative case , but alternate with accusative pronouns . in the same contexts , internal arguments may also receive partitive case to encode features related to aspect or indefiniteness . because these environments lack an external argument coindexed with agreement , the data is particularly relevant to predictions made by burzio 's generalization . by testing burzio 's hypothesis systematically against a range of sentence types , finnish is shown to contain an ergative case subsystem within a nominative-accusative main system . the assignment of the objective cases is linked with the licensing of aspectual roles at d - structure , and finite tense is posited as a bi-unique case assigner . the case split then arises as the result of two case features being assigned simultaneously to an internal argument , objective case at d - structure associated with aspect , and nominative case at s - structure associated with finite tense where an external argument is not available . morphological spell-out rules for particular argument types are proposed which determine the surface case realization of doubly-case assigned nominals . e - mail : info @ garland . com

4 april 1998 . sixteen invited speakers from britain and abroad will give papers . no attempt will be made to achieve a comprehensive coverage of language contact in the ancient mediterranean world , but the focus will instead be on greek and latin in contact both with each other and with other languages . it is intended that some papers should be linguistic in orientation ( i . e . that they should take account of recent research by linguists on bilingualism in modern societies , relating the findings if possible to issues of ancient bilingualism ) , but it is also obvious that historians and literary scholars commonly address problems related to language contact . we hope that the programme of papers will offer a combination of sociolinguistic , literary , cultural and historical approaches to the subject . conference program thursday , april 2 12 . 00 -

entre adn et organisation cellulaire , qu ' en est-il de l ' embryogenese comme hermeneutique du vivant ? * quelle diffrence y a-t - il entre l ' interpretation par le vivant , l ' homme et la machine ? quels modeles en avons-nous et sont-ils conflictuels ? que nous apprend l ' ordinateur comme machine universelle a traiter le signe ? * quel est le role des conflits et antagonismes dans la construction d ' interpretation ? pourquoi les eviter et comment les utiliser ? * comment une interpretation individuelle est-elle possible ou qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation collective et du role de la multiplicite des points de vue , qu ' ils soient methodologiques , contextuels ou de niveaux , et donc des conflits qui peuvent en resulter ? qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation comme resolution des conflits et donc moteur d ' evolution ? * si , comme dans la deuxieme definition du greimas ( voir notes ) , les signes sont toujours deja signifiants , comment peuvent-ils avoir ce statut ? qu ' est-ce qui les rend signifiants ? qu ' en est-il de la pensee symbolique des civilisations anciennes ou orientales et qui a ete cultivee chez nous jusqu ' au moyen - age ( g . durand ) ? comment cette forme d ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle avec les signes decontextualises , jusqu ' a etre calculables et a la conception de l ' interpretation qui en decoule ? * de quels processus de legitimation des interpretations disposons-nous ? quelles relations l ' interpretation entretient-elle avec l ' action ou l ' argumentation que ce soit avant , par ou apres coup ? comment l ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle a la controverse , la negociation , l ' ajustement ? * puisque la simulation joue un role de plus en plus grand dans l ' activite du modelisateur : comment s ' articulent la simulation et l ' interpretation ? ces questions sont au coeur de la plupart des sciences et plus particulirement la semiotique , l ' hermeneutique , les sciences cognitives et neurosciences , la philosophie , la psychologie , la linguistique et psycholinguistique , l ' intelligence artificielle , l ' anthropologie et la sociologie . elles sous-tendent galement l ' activit scientifique , tant dans la modelisation que dans l ' exprimentation . elles sont inseparables des activites des concepteurs - ingenieurs , informaticiens , architectes . . . - dont les productions proviennent de la resolution de conflits d ' interpretations du monde , et sont soumises des conflits d ' interpretation . notes : selon "" semiotique - dictionnaire raisonne de la theorie du langage "" de greimas et courts , on distingue au moins deux acceptions de l ' interpretation , l ' interpretation comme attribution de significations des signes qui en sont depourvus et l ' interpretation comme paraphrase ( au sens large ) de signes deja remplis de significations . cette deuxieme acception fait echo au "" dictionnaire de la psychanalyse "" de laplanche et pontalies qui definit l ' interpretation comme degagement , par l ' investigation analytique , de sens latent dans le dire et les conduites d ' un sujet ; faisant donc reference a la fois au sens deja la et , en plus , sa modalite d ' obtention . soumission des contributions les propositions de communication , de 4 12 pages , devront parvenir en trois exemplaires ou sous forme electronique ( word attache vivement souhaite ) a l ' adresse suivante : christophe parisse , inserm , laboratoire de neuropsychologie de l ' enfant , batiment pharmacie 3eme etage , hopital de la salpetriere , 47 bd de l ' hopital , 75651 paris cedex 13 , france e - mail : parisse @ ext . jussieu . fr dates importantes reception des manuscrits : 31 septembre 1998 notification d ' acceptation : 9 novembre 1998 remise des versions finales : 10 decembre 1998

( normally this kind of software is several hundred dollars ) they even give you easy to understand , proven , step by step instructions for success with this program . in fact , they helped me get started and i ' m so thankful . it 's hard to believe that this as simple as it is , but it really is simple . you will even get support from them via email anytime you need it . you won't get this kind of help from other programs of this nature . it makes all the difference in the world . my name is anne bowman . i am 31 - year-old graduate student desperately trying to finish my degree and begin working in my chosen field that is , if i am lucky enough to find a job in the crowded market . like most people in this day and age , it is hard to make ends meet , and being a student does not help the situation at all ( if i ever have to buy one more box of macaroni and cheese i think i would have to scream ) . i returned to school after having worked for several years with little potential for achieving what i had expected out of life . i figured if i returned to school and received my ph . d there would be several opportunities for me out there to achieve my goals . after seeing my fellow graduate students receive their degrees and , depressingly , not find respectable positions in their chosen field i began to think , "" oh no not again ! "" four extra years in school and an extra $ 20 , 000 in student loans on top of the first $ 18 , 000 , what will i do if the same happens to me ? "" i began to doubt my patience for the long term investment in schooling , and decided enough was enough , "" why can't i make real money now instead of waiting to graduate with no guarantee of a lucrative return for all of my efforts ! "" i am writing to share my experience with other hopeful students out there , as well as anyone looking for an opportunity to take their financial situation into their own hands . i hope you will consider this opportunity seriously and that this will change your life forever ! . , financially ! ! ! and once you get started it takes so little of your time . in mid october 97 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . i took this as a sign ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , it made perfect sense . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start ( about as much as it costs for a pizza ! ) , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" i have nothing to lose "" . initially i sent 15 , 000 emails , ( without any costs to me ) only a couple of hours of my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the time to fulfil my orders . there is a vast on-line market available to everyone who owns a computer . following the advice of the person from whom i received this letter , i am telling you like it is , and i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! after you receive the reports they should explain everything to you . you may have some general questions , however , and after i send you report # 1 , please feel free to contact me and i will give you any advice you need . in one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by mid november , i had received 40 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program you will see that "" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks if you don ' t send out more programs until you do !

"" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it would n't work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her "" hobby . "" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the "" rat race "" and it 's not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md i just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . i even checked with the u . s . post office to verify that the plan was legal . it definitely is ! it works ! ! ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa order your reports today and get started on your road to financial freedom ! ! !

1,"$ 7 money maker and e - mail service please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully . immediately print it and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! ! i didn t believe him , so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just couldn t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other s lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed !

! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the "" internet "" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say "" bull . . . "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : angel ann enterprises p . o . box 668292 charlotte , n . c . 28266-8292 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : m . l . m . 3069 alamo dr . suite 178 vacaville , ca . 95687-6344 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from : c . e . e . p . o . box 5145 framingham , ma 01701-5145 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : m . j . k . p . o . box 30821 seattle , wa 98103-0821 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

( 2 ) review ( 2a ) # 1 - tufftest - lite - free pc diagnostics utility&nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; [ download @ www . ipcug . org ] &nbsp ; you arrive home with your new computer . sure , it hurt paying $ 1 , 800 , but you have it all - - large cardboard boxes , yards of cables , oceans of foam packing . assembly is a snap . as they told you in the store , every cable only fits one way . you follow all the instructions , turn it on and everything is perfect - you are very proud of yourself . &nbsp ; months later you start to experience mysterious problems and occasional system lock ups . probably some software tsr or driver has conflicted with windows again . as before , you spend endless hours trying to track it down , but this time to no avail . then one day , unfortunately just after the warranty runs out , it stops working . when you boot , you see a cryptic error message that says something about memory , or parity , or some such thing . &nbsp ; maybe you ' ll spend a lot of time swapping parts and playing with your computer 's insides - but if you do n't have the time or the skills , you ' ll lug the beast down to the repair shop and wait hours for their low-cost "" instant "" diagnostic service . then you ' ll pay "" more "" to get it fixed . it 's moments like these that you need # 1 - tufftest - lite . &nbsp ; # 1 - tufftest - lite by # 1-pc diagnostics company simply makes sure that your equipment is connected and working . before you set off on a software wild goose chase , # 1 - tufftest - lite blows the whistle on faulty hardware , in this case a bad memory simm in main memory . &nbsp ; sophisticated operating systems blur the line between hardware and software . when a program wants to access a drive , memory or port , windows manages the request . many test programs tell you that they are testing the hardware , but they can't really tell if the problem lies with the hardware , the software that controls it or windows . # 1 - tufftest - lite eliminates the problem by eliminating the complex operating system . &nbsp ; the program fits on a floppy disk and contains its own super slim operating system and device drivers . when it runs tests , nothing stands between them and the pc hardware . # 1 - tufftest - lite can directly attack drives , controllers , ports and memory , giving them a stiff workout and telling you whether they pass muster . &nbsp ; interestingly , this handy little utility reports fewer hardware faults than conventional diagnostic programs - - because it virtually eliminates the false positives that can be generated when software gets in the way . when it does report a problem with your equipment , you can be confident that it is worthwhile dismantling the system and making the trip back to the shop . when # 1 - tufftest - lite gives the all clear , it is sensible to assume that the issue is a software or setup one . &nbsp ; for the technically minded , # 1 - tufftest - lite runs a range of standard hardware checks . it starts with the motherboard and looks at the processor , math coprocessor , dma controller and real time clock . from there , it moves through a series of video and alignment and color tests , and onto the video adapter itself . after that , parallel and serial ports , floppy and hard drives and main memory are run through their paces . &nbsp ; one advantage of its small size is that # 1 - tufftest - lite automatically relocates from lower main memory to upper main memory and then back again on every pass . thus all of main memory is tested . no other diagnostics can do this because they have to occupy a large chunk of it themselves . after finishing with a check of extended memory , # 1 - tufftest - lite reports on your pc and its components . it produces a results display with a simple pass or fail for each component . if everything checks out , you have the satisfaction of knowing that your pc 's internals are a-ok . &nbsp ; the product does n't assume that you are technically minded . to run it , you turn off your pc , place the # 1 - tufftest - lite diskette in the floppy drive a and turn your pc on . the proprietary boot loader and operating system boots your pc and then automatically runs all the tests , with no user intervention if you like . the tests do n't alter any system settings , so even a novice can use it without fear of doing damage . return after 5-10 minutes and the report will be ready . &nbsp ; there is more to pc problem solving than a basic hardware check , but if you can't do that , you can spend a lot of time looking under the wrong rocks . &nbsp ; best of all , # 1 - tufftest - lite is freeware with no restrictions on its use or distribution so you really can't go wrong giving it a try .

1,"judicial judgments - child support - investigator - ( 11116 ) thank you for your interest in our training course ! ! success courses offers an extensive audio training course in "" how to collect judicial judgments "" . if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a judicial judgment is and why processing judicial judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a judicial judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : "" its now up to you to collect on the judgment "" . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . "" in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . "" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows : = b7 mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with judicial judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) = b7 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you do n't call them unless you want to . = b7 you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . = b7 you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . = b7 once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) = b7 when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . = b7 once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote 's from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future . there 's no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on . after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now . "" after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out "" marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only charged me $ 239 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months "" > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum-drum . your brain is challenged . a business which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1-500 - 346-2083 ( this is a standard at&t long distance call discounted to 20 cents per minute from any state at any time of the day ) . we have customer support staff available to you from 7 : 00am to 7 : 00pm ( pacific time ) monday through saturday . closed sunday . if you call this number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + another internet ad campaign produced and distributed by : cyber advertising systems , ny , ny 10011 . please call cyber advertising systems at 1-800 - 409-8302 extension 1284 if you would like us to design and distribute powerful advertising for your company . success courses is pleased with the advertising we have developed for them . if you have a solid well proven product or service then we would be proud to help your company also . if you would like to be removed from cyber advertising systems mailing list then please call toll free 1-800 - 409-8302 extension 1284 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 62487

1,"re : your requested info thank you for your interest in our training course . success courses offers an extensive video tape training course in "" how to collect judicial judgments "" . if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a judicial judgment is and why processing judicial judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a judicial judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : "" its now up to you to collect on the judgment "" . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . "" in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . "" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed in this profession . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with judicial judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you do n't call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote 's from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future . there 's no stopping me now . as of february 3rd , 1995 , thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on . after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now . "" after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out "" marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only charged me $ 189 . 00 for this course and it is a gold mine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months "" > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum drum . your brain is challenged . a business which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1-500 - 488-2035 . we have customer support staff available to you from 7 : 00am to 7 : 00pm ( pacific time ) monday through saturday . closed sunday . if you call this number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + another internet ad campaign produced and distributed by : cyber advertising systems , ny , ny 10011 . please call cyber advertising systems at 1-800 - 409-8302 extension 1284 if you would like us to design and distribute powerful advertising for your company . success courses is pleased with the advertising we have developed for them . if you have a solid well proven product or service then we would be proud to help your company also . if you would like to be removed from cyber advertising systems mailing list then please send an email to : lernerww223 @ yahoo . com and type remove in the subject line . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + % +

1,"info dear ion , i am very happy to have found you . i had no idea so many people also = share this interest in figurative language . i find this very exciting = because it 's the language i work in . the operational language of = computers is binary . the operational language of the human mind is = pictures . i use psychotherapy called metaphor therapy that takes all = figurative statements and treats them literally . if you take an = interest in figurative speech , i thought you might like to know more = about this . it 's an approach that looks for the figures in figurative = speech and uses them to heal or dissolve persistent uncomfortable = feelings . the figures of speech that salt out language reflect the inner figures = of the subconscious mind . so , for example , if someone says there 's a = cloud over his or her head , in the subconscious mind there is a cloud . = the cloud feels real internally because the subconscious mind accepts = what it sees as real ( that 's why dreams appear real when the conscious = mind is turned off during sleep ) . = 20 this is important because it 's the key to the inner mind . treating the = figures ( pictures ) as real opens up the subconscious mind because it = accepted the images as real to begin with . these figures and images = reflect our inner world and bring fascinating information to the = surface . working within the realm of a person 's own symbolic = representation of their problem or issue facilitates profound change . = using words that go to the core of our thinking and feelings helps to = change behavior , decisions and choices . = 20 there is a strong connection between figurative language and healing . = that understanding has produced a new verbal technology for entering the = control center of the mind and healing the psyche . it uses the figures = in language to go to the root of the psyche , where thoughts , feelings = and decisions originate . affecting change from this vantagepoint = produces greater satisfaction in personal life and professional = performance . productivity is , above all , a state of mind ; so we can never = underestimate the power of the mind in affecting all realms of health = and happiness . to best gain an improved control of life , we go to the = control center where thoughts and feelings begin . thoughts and feelings = come to conscious awareness without any effort on our part and they come = directly from the conscious mind . the language of the subconscious is = neither english nor japanese , but pictures and images . metaphor therapy is a unique , innovate approach that speaks the same = operational language as the inner mind . the subconscious mind is not = only the very foundation of our ego , thinking and emotions ; it is also = where most depression , anxiety , eating and compulsive disorders , = phobias , obsessive thoughts , urges and unwanted behavior originate . = while this was already known , what 's new is the understanding that = behind each of these symptoms are persistent uncomfortable feelings . what is also new is the ability to speak a therapeutic picture-language = that goes to the inner mind where obstacles begin , and use these = uncomfortable feelings as a trail that leads to the root of almost any = problem . change occurring at the root is always more dynamic than = change at the surface and leads to outward changes , as well . inner = healing promotes outward change , more control and a stronger mind . going directly into the control center of the mind has an added benefit = of recapturing the wholeness and innate strength we were born with . it = is natural that in the course of growing up we lose parts of self as we = adjust to the demands of the world . as children , we may be subject to = abuse , neglect or trauma . our spirit may be broken or bruised along the = way , but we conform and put our feelings aside . as adults , if we ' re = caught in a life threatening situation where death appears imminent , it = takes even more out of us if the ego dissociates just prior to the = event . shutting down as a way of avoiding the event or the feelings = that go with it , the ego goes somewhere else as a way of not letting it = happen . when qualities and characteristics of self are lost , it leaves = a vague , lingering feeling that something is missing . recovering the missing fragments of self and restoring them is not = esoteric nonsense . it is a concrete discipline based on recent = advancements that permit direct access to our inner mind . speaking the = language of the inner mind affords the best opportunity for healing to = occur . restoration of self dissolves a great many negative feelings , and = makes the mind clearer and the will stronger . metaphor therapy = unleashes the strong , innate power within by using the mind 's ability to heal itself , and creates a base of = self-confidence that is genuine and lasting . = 20 i want to get the word out about metaphor therapy . since this may be = some real hope for some people , please share this letter with others . = as for my part , i would be happy to give you any specific information = about the approach or answer any questions you may have . also , if you 'd = like some examples of healings that were accomplished with the use of = figurative language , please let me know . my best , = 20 = 20 drs www . angelfire . com / ak / drsiegel

"" our revolutionary herbal gel is gently rubbed into the skin . the liposome formula quickly penetrates to the fatty tissue where it liqefies the excess fat on contact . the body then treats the liquefied fat as a waste product and eliminates it naturally through urination . "" another great advantage , "" yates continued , "" is that our product retails for under $ 200 and produces real fat loss - - not water loss - - in 24 hours . "" although our product is new in the united states , it has been sold internationally for four years . the statistics on over one million international customers show an average permanent fat loss of 1 to 1 - 1 / 2 inches in each fat-prone area - - midriff , stomach , hips , thighs , and upper arms - - with just one application . "" yates further explained that the herbal gel is safe and effective to use as many times as needed to achieve individual fat-loss goals , whether people are slightly overweight or extremely overweight . "" we ' re very excited about our product because now people on limited budgets can enjoy the immediate , dramatic results that once only the rich could afford - - without surgery - - and without spending a fortune .

1,"affordable new cars on the internet ? this is not spam . you have received this e-mail because you expressed a desire in purchasing an automobile , or you recently visited one of our affiliates web sites . we apologize if this e-mail is unsolicited . please scroll down to the bottom of this message for instructions on declining targeted e-mail . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + hello , my name is kevin cross . i have put the the auto program together to show people methods that i have used to obtain vehicles with no down payment or security deposit needed . i had bad credit , but i did not want to drive a junker ; i wanted to drive a nice late model vehicle . i have always liked nice automobiles as long as i can remember . i have obtained my last two automobiles without having to put any money down and with my less than desirable credit . an automobile is the single biggest expense most people make besides there home . unlike homes , most automobiles depreciate in value . that is why putting out no money on downpayments or security deposits on a car purchase or lease is smart . although the auto program was initially put together for people like myself whom have bad or no credit , this program is also valuable to people with excellent or good credit , since you will be saving the money you would normally have to pay in downpayment money or security deposits . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + + + read what others have to say : + + + "" i ordered the auto program monday and that friday i had obtained a 1995 geo tracker 4x4 with no money down and my monthly payments are only $ 179 per month "" e . b . columbus , ohio . "" using the methods in your auto program i obtained a 1997 bmw convertible with no money down , thanks for showing me how to obtain a great car even though i had bad credit . "" m . h . columbus , ohio note : ( testimonial section has full unsolicited letters from customers that have used the auto program . ) whether you have bad credit and can not get financed , or if you have excellent credit and want to eliminate the downpayment or security deposit without increasing the monthly payment , the auto program will work for you . requirements : you must be currently employed or have a source of income and be able to make monthly payments on time . that 's it ! no car salesman to deal with ! you do not have to deal with the normal stress related to dealing with a car salesman . this also means you do not have to deal with getting rejected because of bad credit or having to take a car that is older and not the car you really want . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ easy to use just follow the simple , step by step , directions in the auto program and obtain the late model vehicle you want . that is how easy the auto program is to use . it explains everything you need to know to obtain the late model vehicle of your choice with no downpayment or security deposit required . just pay normal monthly car payments . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ savings to you : the auto program will save you between $ 500 to $ 5000 dollars since you will not be required to put a down payment or security deposit on the vehicle you obtain . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ no risk , 100 % money-back guarantee the 100 % money-back guarantee is in writing in the auto program . you can return the auto program anytime within 30 days for a full refund if you are not able to obtain a late model vehicle with no downpayment or security deposit . this guarantee is regardless of your credit history as long as you use the simple methods in the auto program . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ frequently asked questions q : how long does it take to obtain a vehicle once i receive the auto program ? a : it is all up to you and how quickly you actively use the methods provided in the auto program . example : eric brown from columbus , oh , ordered the auto program on a monday and on friday of the same week he called to tell us he obtained the vehicle he wanted . q : is this program just for people with bad or no credit ? a : no , the auto program is also for people with good credit who do not want to put down the normally required downpayment . the auto program shows you how to obtain the vehicle of your choice with no money down . so , you can use your money saved from not paying a downpayment to buy better things ! q : i can lease a car or truck from a car dealership without a down payment . . . just pay monthly lease payments . why do i need the auto program ? a : many of our customers have thought that , until they tried to lease a car from a dealership . first , you must have excellent credit to lease a car or truck . with a lease , you have to put down a security deposit , first and last lease payments , and capitalized cost reduction which is the same thing as a down payment . . . just a different name ! when you lease a car from a dealership , you have to put down the same or more as when you buy a car ! q : the monthly car payments must be high since there is no downpayment required , right ? a : the monthly car payments are the regular amount . it is just the same as if someone paid a downpayment , but through our revolutionary method , no downpayment is needed . q : is the auto program too good to be true ? a : the step-by - step methods in the auto program have been approved by my lawyer and have been market tested by many satisfied customers . i am so confident you will benefit from the auto program that i put my name and a 100 % money-back guarantee behind it ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ testimonials mr . kevin cross , it is with great pleasure that i give my warmest appreciation to your company for providing me with the necessary tools to successfully secure a late model chevy cavalier using the 1st and most preferred method . i purchase the program on january 3 , and secured a vehicle on january 6 ; likewise , i had more than one option available to me ! i also had to opportunity to assume the lease on a late model acura legend or assume the lease on a late model bmw . but , of course , i made the wisest and most financially sound decision and purchased the chevy cavalier . . . . in closing , i graciously thank you and wish you continued success in your quest to help others . professionally , d . s . + + + dear gentlemen : . . . i am writing to tell you of my good fortune in acquiring a new ford escort wagon from ricart ford . i think that your program did help instill some confidence in me that i could get a new car . at least i knew that i had to do something about the piece of junk i was driving . thank you for your assistance in helping me realize my dream of owning a new vehicle . i still can't believe my good fortune . i am leasing the car for two years with an option to buy at a fixed rate from ford motor credit . again , thank you for your assistance . respectfully yours , c . b . + + + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the auto program sells for $ 59 . 95 , but take advantage of this internet offer and order for only $ 29 . 95 ! ! ! + + + order the auto program now for $ 29 . 95 ( plus $ 2 . 90 s / h ) + + + order today and i will include two valuable reports , free ! l . getting good automotive service 2 . nine ways to lower your auto insurance cost order now : call to order toll free : 888 324-1873 or ( 614 ) 529-1390 pay with personal check , visa , or mastercard right over the phone . for any questions pertaining to the auto program , call ( 614 ) 529-1390 please be patient when calling to order . if you have any difficulty connecting , please try again later . or send payment to : kevin cross 1773 hobbes drive hilliard , ohio 43026 i would like to say to anyone that might doubt whether the auto program will really work for them , i completely understand . i have bought a lot of how-to information manuals that were complete hype and did not have valuable information . if the auto program was not already proven to work , i would not have my name and a money-back guarantee in writing in the auto program . # # # # # # # # # # under bill s . 1618 title iii passed by the 105th u . s . congress , this e-mail is in compliance with the law . to remove your name from our list , please reply to this e-mail with the subject line "" remove .

1,"just released vol . 2 just released ! ! ! introducing . . . the cd vol . 2 the cd - vol . 2 , is the absolute best product of its ' kind anywhere in the world today . there are no other products anywhere that can compete with the quality of this product . we took a total of over 190 million email addresses from many of the touted cd 's that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 300 + million addresses in one huge file . we ran a super "" sort / de-dupe "" program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 20 million ! ! ! can you believe that ? it seems that most people that are selling cd 's are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program "" generated "" email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon 's , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables . after completion of removal of duplicates and initial filtering we were left with the base of 10 million addresses worth fine tuning to finish the project . remember , we are not here to produce the cd with the gad zillion millions that our competitors are so proud to put their names on these days . we are here to produce the very best cd list as far as quality of addresses go we then ran a program that contained 300 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , mil , . org , . gov , genie , delphi , gnn , wow etc . we also filtered out all addresses found in any of our 1300 + domains list . we also filtered out addresses in excess of 30 , 000 which have proven to be affiliated with anyone found to be opposed to our using direct bulk email as a advertising medium . we have also purged the list to be free of any "" web poison "" addresses created by those who are opposed to us conducting legitimate business on the internet today . if you do not know what web poisoned addresses are , please look it up now . one list we recently purchased had over 90 % poisoned addresses . the "" bottom line "" here is that you can go out on the world market today and purchase every lists for thousands of dollars and not have anymore worth owning than what we have compiled for you here today . you use these addresses , you will experience increased response , increased sales , and a host of other positives that far exceeds any hoped for results when using the competitor 's inferior products . our customers purchase our products over and over and over . most of the competition ever succeeds is selling a second product to anyone after they purchase the first . so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 200 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and a lot less time ! ! we have always said , "" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best "" . your choice . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what others are saying : "" i received the cd on friday evening . like a kid with a new toy , i immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses . over the course of the weekend , i emailed out over 500 , 000 emails and i received less than twenty undeliverables ! ! i am totally satisfied with my purchase ! ! thanks premier ! !

"" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . everyday for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate !

go for it now ! ! karen liddell the following is a copy of the e-mail i read : $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legal , money-making phenomenon . print this letter , read the directions , then read it again !

"" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! "" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . "" dawn w . , evansville , in "" no free lunch "" "" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . "" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders !

1,"just released ! 10 million ! ! ! it was just released ! ! introducing . . . millions vol . 1a we took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the touted cd 's that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 100 + million addresses in one huge file . we then ran a super "" sort / de-dupe "" program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 25 million ! ! ! can you believe that ? it seems that most people that are selling cd 's are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program "" generated "" email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon 's , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash , etc . we then ran a program that contained 1800 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , . mil , . org , . gov , etc . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 10 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and alot less time ! ! we also purchased cyber - promos ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber 's email addresses from top to bottom . we cleaned these , and came up with about 100 , 000 addresses . these are also mixed in . we also included a 6 + million "" remove / flamer "" file broke into seperate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes . "" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . your choice . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what others are saying : "" i received the cd on friday evening . like a kid with a new toy , i immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses . over the course of the weekend , i emailed out over 500 , 000 emails and i received less than twenty undeliverables ! ! i am totally satisfied with my purchase ! ! thanks premier ! !

if it seems like i am bragging and rubbing it in about how i ' m going to make bundles of money from your efforts it 's true ! ! you should be as excited as i am because report # 5599 allows you to duplicate my efforts !

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a "" no brainer "" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself ! q . how many hours a week will i have to devote to my business ? a . one to sixty hours a week ! here 's a question i will answer with a question . . . how much money do you want to make ? common sense says the more ads you run and the more mailings you do the more money you will make ! the statistics show that for every 100 responses you receive from your ads , and you mail this sales letter , you will sell five to ten reports making you $ 250 . 00 to $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . your ad responses will vary depending on the place you advertise and the circulation of the publication . the more ads you run or the more emails you send out the more time you will need to devote to your home based business . q . just how much money will i need to start my home based business ? a . $ 50 . 00 ! yeah i know - you ' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i ' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n't think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 ! q . if i have additional questions who will answer them for me ? a . i will or the parent company will ! no package of information , no matter how complete , can possibly answer every question that may come up . i do not want you to lose money seeking out the answers . i want you to succeed ! you will receive a phone number in report # 5599 where you can either reach me or someone from the parent company for any question or help you need ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ here 's a valuable bonus for ordering within 5 days . . . . your 's absolutely free !

1,"see if this doesn ' t interest you . . . . read the 1st paragraph ! if you are convinced that this is not for you , then delete it . my bet is that you will be intrigued enough to finish reading it before you make your decision . financial success brochure dear fellow advertiser : my name is tim brody and i make a living selling a recipe for potato cheese pierogies . this is all i do , and i earn in excess of $ 100 , 000 each year . incredible you say ? now , i am revealing my secret to you . incredible , you say ? it is completely legal and , you too , can be well on your way to earning $ 100 , 000 per year by selling your product , plans , recipe or information through the mail . before i reveal my plan to you , let me tell you a little about myself . five years ago , i placed a classified ad in a food magazine to earn a little extra money . my response was 11 orders and 43 "" get rich quick "" schemes . now , please don t laugh , over the next three years i tried all of those "" get rich quick "" schemes . some actually met with success while many met with complete failure . with each try , i learned something new about marketing my product . finally , this plan came together and in the first 3 months , i made over $ 25 , 000 . after i tried it again , i earned $ 35 , 000 and it became clear to me that i was on my way to financial freedom . now please , this story is not merely to brag . i want you to realize the hard work , persistence and expense that went in to making this program a success . it is also my way of teaching others the problems of many marketing plans , and , hopefully , they will be able to avoid many of my own mistakes and expenses . this program is not for everyone . if you are planning to make a million dollars or to compete with your fellow participants , then this plan is not for you . however , if earning $ 100 , 000 a year in a stress-free program interests you , please read on , you are among the sincere people needed to make this program a success . maybe you have participated in some of those "" get rich quick "" programs before . you probably were dissatisfied with your response rate from the classifieds or mailings ? were you expecting to receive additional income but didn t even receive enough responses to pay for the ad or the stamps ? if you are like others , the answer is yes ! please do not give up hope just yet . there is a way to make money and have fun , as well as fine tune your culinary taste . join a network of buyers and sellers with similar goals for no additional costs . the process is called multi - level marketing and it is not illegal . ( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to "" show "" to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ?

1,". . . . . use hypnosis to make money ! hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n't be so many advertisements . but they are n't making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn ' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n't care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n't go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , "" i lost 15 pounds "" or "" i quit smoking . "" they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying "" they "" because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n't you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n't even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n't . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n't have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won't hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n't feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .

1,"improvements in wound care ! hello , my name is kevin elphick and i am the managing director of nursing innovations which have been manufacturing and supplying a range of innovative wound dressing protectors named ' keep - dri dressings ' to australian hospitals for a period in excess of 8 years . these internationally award winning products are now extensively used in over 70 % of western australian hospitals ( references available upon request ) and we are now looking at supplying to hospitals internationally . however , we have found from experience it is difficult to initially introduce the product to hospitals . once a hospital starts using keep - dri dressings they have always continued to use them . our success is related to the fact that they are quick and easy to apply ( saving staff time ) and they really work . the result is lower infection risk , reduced patient trauma and lower cost for the hospital . for your free sample contact me at my web site http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone here you will find a full product description , uses and advantages and a link to my email address . i would appreciate any suggestions you might have to help introduce this excellent product into hospitals in your area or comments you have on our product . many thanks in advance . kevin elphick nursing innovations 23 yulema street mullaloo , perth , western australia 6027 618-9487 - 1807 http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * k

1,"re : check this out ! dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , "" please put me on your mailing list "" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you ' ve received $ 813 , 615 !

"" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money !

"" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try .

"" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 20 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 20 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 20 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 2000 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 20 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash !

"" the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to "" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in . 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to "" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goa . l . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , 1 received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . the economy , inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . 1 do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps "" a "" through "" f "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would hpppen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e - mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet advertising on the ' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let 's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) assuming that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . ist level - - your 10 members with $ 5 - - $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must dc , is e-mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number and name - 1 - - * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 "" the insider 's guide to advertising for free on the internet "" order report # 1 from : crossroads enterprises 5507-10 nesconset hwy . # 317 mt . siani , ny . 11766 report # 2 "" the insider 's guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet "" order report # 2 from : laura waite rfd1 box 798 campton , nh . 03223 report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet "" order report 43 from : philip webster 1011 second st . port orange , fl . 32119 report # 4 "" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet "" order report # 4 from : patricia arnold 174 windward ct . s . port jefferson , ny . 11777 about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * * * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! above all , have faith in yourself and know you wilt , succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e - mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program . please answer one question . do you want to change your life ? if the answer is yes , please look at the following facts about this program : 1 . you are selling a product which does not cost anything to produce , ship or advertise . 2 . all of your customers pay you in cash ! 3 . e - mail is without question the most powerful method of distributing information on earth . this program combines the distribution power of e-mail together with the revenue generating power of multi-level marketing . 4 . your only expenses other than your initial $ 20 investment is your time ! 5 . virtually all of the income you generate from this program is pure profit ! 6 . this program will change your life forever . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won't work and you ' ll lose a lot of potential income . i ' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you ' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 19 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for a while , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi . i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa i am nearing the $ 90 , 000 mark from this program . i have used several forms of advertisement . i used regular mail and bulk email . the regular mail was very expensive for 2 reasons . i purchased a very select list names , and the postage . the 3rd time i sent out e - mails , in the quantity of 700 , 000 . so , after 3 times participating in this program , i am almost at the $ 90 , 000 mark . that is n't too bad . i hope the same success for you . good luck . . . . raymond mccormick , new cannan , ct . you have great potential for extra earnings that is available at your finger-tips ! you have unlimited access to wealth , but you must be willing to take that first step ! the media already proved that ! ! ! ! ! ! you could be making an obscene amount of money ! i have given you the information , materials , and opportunity to become financially better off . it is up to you now ! - think about it - your risk is only $ 20 . ?

"" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to "" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to "" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull . . . "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps "" a "" through "" f "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 4 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . in addition you will be provided with information on internet marketing clubs such as internet marketing resources ( imr ) : this is one the premiere internet marketing clubs on the internet . this club provides a forum where internet marketers from all over the world can exchange ideas and secrets on internet marketing . in addition , this club specializes in providing free internet marketing tools and services for the do - yourself - internet - marketer . they will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 1 , 000 , 000 fresh e-mail addresses each week . this club will provide you with hundreds of free resources which include : how to obtain free web sites , how to obtain top rankings in search engines for your web-site , how to send bulk e-mail into aol and compuserve , how to market your products on newsgroups , free classified ads , electronic malls , bulletin boards , banner ads and much more . imr ' s web address is : http : / / www . ixpres . com / imrs / marketing1 . htm ( not working . . . check the links below ) http : / / www . onlinemlm . com / http : / / www . promlm . com / resources / index . shtml there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the ' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let 's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 - - - - - - - - - - - this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report ! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - available reports - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - * * * order each report by number and name * * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper - on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" the insider 's guide to advertising for free on the internet "" order report # 1 from : aj marketing p . o . box 946 nordvest posthus , glasvej 3 copenhagen denmark _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" the insider 's guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet "" order report # 2 from : eyal hilel 21 bar - ilan st . kfar - saba 44378 israel . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet "" order report # 3 from : dikton haxhijaj homburgerstr . 68 61191 rosbach germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet "" order report # 4 from : ellbee enterprises p . o . box 452233 los angeles , ca 90045 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program . please answer one question . do you want to change your life ?
